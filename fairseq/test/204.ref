where is the friend 's home ? ( persian : &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; ) is a 1987 iranian film directed and written by iranian director abbas kiarostami . the title of the film was derived from a poem by sohrab &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; . it is considered the first film in kiarostami 's &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; trilogy , followed by life , and nothing more ... and through the olive trees , all of which take place in &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , iran . the film tells a deceptively simple account of a &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; schoolboy 's quest to return his friend 's notebook in a neighboring village , since , should his friend fail to hand it in the next day , it is likely he will get expelled . hence this film has been seen as a metaphor for the sense of civil duty , about loyalty and everyday heroics . the traditional beliefs of iranian rural people are also shown in many parts of the movie . the film is among the top ten in the bfi list of the 50 films you should see by the age of 14 .
