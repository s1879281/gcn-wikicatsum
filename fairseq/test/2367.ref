secrets ( also titled one crazy night ) is a 1992 australian film directed by michael pattinson and starring &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; minogue and noah taylor . the film follows four of the beatles ' biggest fans ( and an elvis presley fan who hates the beatles ) , who find themselves locked up in the basement of the hotel where the beatles are staying during a tour . while waiting for rescue , they start to share their &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; secrets with each other . the film has notable similarities to the breakfast club , in terms of plot , style and characters . the film 's soundtrack consisted of instrumental &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; of many beatles songs . however , the movie attracted criticism for including a number of songs from much later periods of the beatles ' history to the one being portrayed onscreen . thus , scenes depicting 1964 &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; were played against songs from later albums such as abbey road and sgt. pepper 's lonely hearts club band , which many viewers felt did not fit with the tone of the film .
