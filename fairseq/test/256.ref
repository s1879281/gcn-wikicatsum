a &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; redundancy check ( &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; ) is an &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; code commonly used in digital networks and storage devices to detect accidental changes to raw data . blocks of data entering these systems get a short check value attached , based on the remainder of a &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; division of their contents . on retrieval , the &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; is repeated and , in the event the check values do not match , corrective action can be taken against data corruption . &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; can be used for error correction , see &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; . &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; are so called because the check ( data &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; ) value is a redundancy ( it expands the message without adding information ) and the algorithm is based on &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; codes . &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; are popular because they are simple to implement in binary hardware , easy to analyze &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , and particularly good at &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; common errors caused by noise in transmission channels . because the check value has a fixed length , the function that generates it is occasionally used as a hash function . the &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; was invented by w. wesley peterson in 1961 ; the &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; function of &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; and many other standards is the work of several researchers and was published in 1975 .
