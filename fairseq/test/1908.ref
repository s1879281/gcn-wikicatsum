digital intermediate ( typically abbreviated to di ) is a motion picture finishing process which classically involves &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; a motion picture and manipulating the color and other image characteristics . it often replaces or &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; the &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; timing process and is usually the final creative adjustment to a movie before distribution in theaters . it is distinguished from the &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; process in which film is scanned and color is manipulated early in the process to facilitate editing . however the lines between &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; and di are continually blurred and are often executed on the same hardware by &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; of the same background . these two steps are typically part of the overall color management process in a motion picture at different points in time . a digital intermediate is also &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; done at higher resolution and with greater color fidelity than &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; transfers . although originally used to describe a process that started with film &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; and ended with film recording , digital intermediate is also used to describe color correction and color &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; and even final mastering when a digital camera is used as the image source and/or when the final movie is not output to film . this is due to recent advances in digital cinematography and digital projection technologies that strive to match film &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; and film projection . in traditional &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; film finishing , an intermediate is produced by exposing film to the original camera negative . the intermediate is then used to &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; the films that get distributed to theaters . color &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; is done by varying the amount of red , green , and blue light used to expose the intermediate . this seeks to be able to replace or &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; the &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; approach to creating this intermediate . the digital intermediate process uses digital tools to color grade , which allows for much &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; control of individual colors and areas of the image , and allows for the adjustment of image structure ( grain , &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , etc. ) . the intermediate for film reproduction can then be produced by means of a film recorder . the physical intermediate film that is a result of the recording process is sometimes also called a digital intermediate , and is usually recorded to &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; ( in ) stock , which is inherently &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; than camera negative ( &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; ) . one of the key technical achievements that made the transition to di possible was the use of the 3d &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; tables ( aka " 3d &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; " ) , which could be used to mimic how the digital image would look once it was printed onto release print stock . this removed a large amount of skilled &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; from the film-making process , and allowed greater freedom in the colour &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; process while reducing risk . the digital master is often used as a source for a &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; distribution of the motion picture for digital projection . for archival purposes , the digital master created during the digital intermediate process can still be recorded to very stable high dynamic range &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; ( &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; ) &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; on black-and-white film with an expected &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; or longer life . this archival format , long used in the industry prior to the invention of di , still provides an archival medium that is independent of changes in digital data recording technologies and file formats that might otherwise render digitally archived material &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; in the long term .
