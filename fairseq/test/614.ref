a medical animation is a short educational film , usually based around a &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; or surgical topic , that is rendered using 3d computer graphics . while it may be intended for an array of audiences , the medical animation is most commonly utilized as an instructional tool for medical professionals or their patients . early medical animations were limited to basic &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; models because of low &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; speed . however , rapid evolution in &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; design and computer memory has led to animations that are significantly more intricate . the medical animation may be viewed as a standalone visualization , or in combination with other sensory input devices , such as &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; displays , stereoscopic lenses , &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; gloves , interactive &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , or cave automatic virtual environments ( caves ) .
