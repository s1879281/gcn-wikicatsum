now look here is a bbc situation comedy which ran for two series of seven episodes each during 1971 to 1973 . it was written by barry cryer . it starred ronnie corbett , who played a character of the same name . he was in a rather similar role to that which he played in the later , &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; and better-known situation comedy , sorry ! , as an &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; mother 's boy who was trying to break away from his mother ( played by madge ryan ) but having some difficulty doing so . however it differs from the later series in that he does leave home after a few episodes , although his new home is only a few doors away , his father is deceased and he does not have any siblings . in the second series he was married ( his wife played by rosemary leach ) . his boss was played by donald hewlett . all episodes still exist , although one of these survived in the american ntsc standard , from which it has been converted .
