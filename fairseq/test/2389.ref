marcello francesco &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; ( &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; â€“ october 17 , 1637 ) was an italian jesuit missionary who was &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; in japan on mount &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; during the tokugawa shogunate , which had banned christianity in &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; . after sailing for japan out to find and possibly &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; the notorious &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; ferreira , who went to japan and &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; his faith there , he was arrested as soon as he got off his ship . after three days of torture in the pit of nagasaki , he was &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; . a painting of his death , martyrdom of saint marcello &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; ( &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; ) , was made by antonio maria &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; . &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; to visions , he was particularly influenced by &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; by the jesuit missionary st. francis xavier , who appeared to him twice in &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , and &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; him his martyrdom . st. frances xavier is credited with twice miraculously restoring &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; 's health ( even if only to incite him to do missionary work in japan ) , and since the account reportedly spread quickly through italy , the " &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; of grace , " in honor of st. francis xavier , was established . &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; 's initiative is supposedly to thank for the presence of a silver casket in the &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; of bom jesus in old goa , which houses relics of the body of st. francis xavier .
