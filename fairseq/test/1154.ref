otoko wa tsurai yo ( 男はつらいよ , " it 's tough being a man " ) is a japanese film series starring kiyoshi atsumi as " tora-san " ( &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; ) , a kind-hearted vagabond who is always unlucky in love . the series itself is often referred to as " tora-san " by its fans . spanning 48 installments released between 1969 and 1995 , all of the otoko wa tsurai yo films except episodes 3 ( azuma &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; ) and 4 ( shun ' ichi kobayashi ) were directed by yōji yamada , who also wrote ( or co-wrote ) all the screenplays . each film featured a different leading lady , called a madonna , and a different region of japan . ( there were also episodes that featured scenes in arizona and vienna . ) two films were usually made each year between 1969 and 1989 , one for summer and one for new year release . from 1990 to 1995 only one film was made each year , for new year release . &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; released a boxset of the first four films in the united states in 2009 under the title " tora-san " . the series holds the guinness world record for the longest-running movie series starring a single actor . the film series ended with atsumi 's declining health and death from lung cancer at age 68 , without tora-san ever settling down and finding domestic happiness . atsumi was so identified with the tora-san character that his death was also considered by fans to be the death of tora-san . director yamada decided not to continue the series after atsumi 's death , but reworked a tora-san script stuck in development as niji wo &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; otoko starring nishida toshiyuki as a traveling cinema operator . although niji was a tribute to movies in general , the final scenes were yamada 's touching , loving posthumous tribute to the tora-san series and to atsumi kiyoshi . almost all of the principal actors from otoko wa tsurai yo have cameos in the niji film , and the tora-san character even makes a surprise cameo appearance near the end of the movie &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; that perhaps tora is still out there somewhere . the film ends with a dedication to atsumi kiyoshi .
