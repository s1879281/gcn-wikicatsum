the unknown is a 1927 american silent horror film directed by tod browning and featuring lon chaney as carnival knife &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; alonzo the &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; and joan crawford as the &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; clad carnival girl he hopes to marry . film historian ken &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; considers the film to be in many respects the best of browning 's films with lon chaney . burt lancaster said that chaney 's portrayal in the unknown featured “ one of the most compelling and emotionally &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; scenes i have ever seen an actor do . ” chaney did remarkable and convincing collaborative scenes with real-life &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; double paul &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; ( sometimes credited as peter &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; ) , whose legs and feet were used to manipulate objects such as knives and cigarettes in frame with chaney 's upper body and face . as with browning 's later sound film freaks ( 1932 ) , contemporary reviewers were sometimes less appreciative . " a visit to the &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; room in a hospital would be quite as pleasant , " opined the new york evening post , " and at the same time more &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; . " modern viewers can &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; the same macabre style of this film ( and other &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; collaborations ) in later productions ranging from the 1930s universal studios horror films to the 1960s twilight zone and alfred hitchcock presents programs .
