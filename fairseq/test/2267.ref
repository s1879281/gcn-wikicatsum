in the united states , a midnight movie is a b movie or cult film shown at midnight , either at a cinema or on television . the practice started in the 1950s with local television stations around the united states airing low-budget genre films as late-night programming , often with a host delivering sardonic asides . as a cinematic phenomenon , the midnight screening of offbeat movies began in the early 1970s in a few urban centers , particularly new york city , eventually spreading across the country . the screening of &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; pictures at midnight was aimed at building a cult film audience , encouraging repeat viewing and social interaction in what was originally a countercultural setting . the national success of the rocky horror picture show and the changing economics of the film exhibition industry altered the nature of the midnight movie phenomenon ; as its association with broader trends of cultural and political opposition &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; in the 1980s , the midnight movie became a more purely camp experience â€” in effect , bringing it closer to the television form that shares its name . the term midnight movie is now often used in two different , though related , ways : as a synonym for b movie , reflecting the relative &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; characteristic of late-night movies both theatrically and on tv , and as a synonym for cult film .
