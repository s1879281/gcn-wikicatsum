&lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; ( or crime 101 in the us release ) is a low-budget 1999 new zealand film set in the southern university city of &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; . the film 's original title comes from the local nickname for university students , &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , so called because of the traditional blue and gold &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; worn by students during the city 's cool winters in support of the otago rugby football union . &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; starts off as a light comedy centred on a group of five students who get together after moving into a flat that is seemingly abandoned , but still has the power on , making for free if filthy accommodation . the film twists into something darker part way through , with elements of both black comedy and thriller . the discovery of a large crop of marijuana being grown in the basement leads firstly to &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , then paranoia and arguments amongst the &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; about what will happen when the real owners come back to collect it . when kevin , the crop 's owner appears , the students , fearing for their lives , lock him in the basement . events unfold against a backdrop of the city 's biggest sporting event for years , the final of new zealand 's national rugby championship . despite the deliberate use of shots focusing on the city 's &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; and darker elements , much of the film 's photography and soundtrack is an homage to the city , including the use of several &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; sound songs in the soundtrack ( top local band the clean even make a cameo appearance during the film ) . the film was well-received , described as " ... the most &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; entertaining new zealand film for years ... " , and did well at the box-office .
