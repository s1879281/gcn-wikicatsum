in economics and finance , a &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; distribution is the statistical profile of an investment which normally provides a &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; of small positive returns , while carrying a small but significant risk of catastrophic losses . the term was coined by journalist martin wolf and economist john kay to describe investments with a " high probability of a modest gain and a low probability of huge losses in any period . " the concept is named after &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; nicholas &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , based on ideas outlined in his &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; by &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; . according to &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; in silent risk , the term should be called " &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; " to reflect the importance of the &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; function of the underlying probability distribution , rather than the distribution itself . the term is meant to refer to an investment returns profile in which there is a high probability of a small gain , and a small probability of a very large loss , which more than &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; the gains . in these situations the expected value is very much less than zero , but this fact is camouflaged by the appearance of low risk and steady returns . it is a combination of &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; risk and &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; risk : overall returns are dominated by extreme events ( &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; ) , which are to the &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; ( &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; ) . more detailed and formal discussion of the bets on small probability events is in the academic essay by &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , called " why did the crisis of 2008 happen ? " and in the 2004 paper in the journal of behavioral finance called " why do we prefer &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; ? " in which he writes " agents risking other people â€™s capital would have the incentive to &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; the properties by showing a steady income . &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , hedge funds are paid on an annual basis while disasters happen every four or five years , for example . the fund manager does not &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; his incentive fee .
