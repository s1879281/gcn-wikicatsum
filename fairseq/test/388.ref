greatest video hits 1 was the first queen video collection on dvd . most of the content was released previously on vhs and the long defunct &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; format as greatest flix in 1981 . it was released in october 2002 , and included video hits of the band between 1973 and 1981 . the dvd peaked at number one in uk , with sales of more than &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; copies . it was also the best selling dvd of the year in 2002 . it was also number one in usa ( platinum ) , germany ( gold ) , spain and other countries . it was also 4 times platinum in australia , 3 times platinum in canada , platinum in poland , and other places . most music videos on the dvd have been converted to 16:9 widescreen . this was achieved by &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; large amounts of picture from the top and bottom of the original 4:3 frame . this has caused much controversy among many fans who want the videos presented in their original aspect ratio , and see the conversion as unnecessary and detrimental to the original material .
