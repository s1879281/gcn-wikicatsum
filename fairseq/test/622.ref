window to paris ( russian : &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; в &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; ) is a 1993 russian drama film directed by yuri &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; . some french friends suggested that yuri &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; should make a joint &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; film , which led to the creation of the 1993 film " window to paris " or " &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; russe " . the film starts with residents of a saint petersburg communal apartment of 1990s finding a window hidden behind a cupboard that leads to a &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; roof and shows the effect of this discovery . the film is a grotesque prediction of the effect of fall of the iron curtain on the life in europe , about the invasion of russian &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; businessmen and the humiliation of the &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; in russia . at the end of the film , the main character , nikolai &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , a school music teacher and a member of the russian &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , gives a persuasive speech to the children , who have decided to remain in paris . in his words : you were born in a terrible time in a poor , devastated country . but it is your country , after all ! do n't you want to make it better ? at that time , this was a rather rare demonstration of patriotism ; the authors of the film and all its actors were quite sincere . as a division of lenfilm , the film company &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; most refused to participate in financing the project , thus putting the french partners on the edge of financial collapse and threatening the production of the film . because of this situation , yuri &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; was urged to establish his own film company in order to attract support from commercial businesses that were thriving in &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; russia . that is how yuri &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; 's fountain fund for support and development of cinematography was created . the name of the fund , " fountain " , is from &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; 's preceding film that won the grand prize at a french film festival , which had been organized under the &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; of madame danielle mitterrand , the wife of the french then-president françois mitterrand . it was this in particular that facilitated financing for the film " window to paris " from the french fund cnc . the comedy " window to paris " attained such success in france and at the berlin film festival that michael barker , the &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; of the american distribution company sony pictures classics , arranged for the film to be released in the united states , and twice requested goskino to submit the film " window to paris " for the 1994 academy award for best foreign language film . barker wrote : " the response to the film at screenings in los angeles and new york has been terrific with both the critics and the audiences . it seems to communicate the message of bringing two cultures together in a warm and &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; manner ... should ' &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; russe ' be the official russian entry to the academy for the best foreign film academy award , we feel confident the picture will not only be nominated for the award , but has a very good chance to ultimately win the award itself . " however , at that time nikita mikhalkov , with his &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; finished film " burnt by the sun " , greatly wished to be considered for the oscar . after the chairman of the russian oscar committee , &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , did not agree to submit mikhalkov ’s film to the competition , mikhalkov demonstrated his outstanding skills in behind-the-scenes &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; . &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; was immediately replaced by mikhalkov 's brother , andrey konchalovsky , who agreed to send the film " burnt by the sun " to the united states . thus , &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; was deprived of the opportunity to win the oscar . the members of the russian oscar committee remain under the control of nikita mikhalkov , who shapes the politics of russian cinematography . therefore , in &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; 's opinion , neither the best nor the most talented films are being submitted to the american film academy , but rather the ones created by mikhalkov 's favorite artists . nikita mikhalkov is currently vladimir putin 's cinematography adviser . the idea of a mystical window , a dimensional portal between russia and paris , came to the mind of the moscow screenwriter felix &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; long before &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; 's &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; . he told this idea to the filmmaker aleksey german , who sold it 20 years later to arkady &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , yuri &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; ' co-author , for a bottle of cognac . " window to paris " may be truly called a people 's film . it is the most famous of all yuri &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; ’s works , and is loved by millions of viewers around the world . many quotations from the film have become folk &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; .
