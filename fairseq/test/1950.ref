the great bookie robbery was a crime committed in melbourne , australia on 21 april 1976 . a &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; gang of six stole what is widely believed to be from $ 14 to $ 16 million ( 2011 : $ 88 million ) from &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; in the victoria club , which was located on the second floor of a building in queen street , melbourne . the true figure for the amount stolen has never been confirmed , as the victoria club quoted the missing figure to police as only $ 1 million to avoid the attention of the australian taxation office ( &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; ) . the men , who included raymond " chuck " bennett who is believed to be the mastermind , ian carroll , laurence prendergast and norman lee , rented an office several floors above and hid the money in that room 's safe before &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; walking out of the building and onto the street . the identity of the robbers was widely known in the underworld and bennett became the target of &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; men ( who included brian and leslie kane ) and corrupt police demanding part of the proceeds . the kane brothers were particularly violent &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; who wanted ' their cut ' and were willing to torture , &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; and kill to get their own way . after being told that the &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; intended to kill him , bennett , prendergast and vincent &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; murdered leslie kane on 19 october 1978 and went into hiding . the three were later arrested for leslie kane 's murder but as the body was never found the charges were dismissed . with brian kane threatening to kill him , bennett was arrested on a minor charge in 1979 . while being escorted by police from the courthouse holding cells to the courtroom he was taken up a flight of stairs into the path of a man disguised as a barrister . this man shot bennett several times in the chest , he tried to flee but collapsed on the courthouse steps and died a short time later . although brian kane was suspected , circumstantial evidence suggested a conspiracy to kill bennett which included senior members of the victorian police , most notably brian murphy , with whom bennett had a long-standing feud . no one has ever been arrested for bennett â€™s murder which was in effect , an execution . the money was never recovered and although norman lee was charged he was later acquitted . none of the other members of the gang were ever convicted . prendergast had disappeared in 1985 and apart from lee , the rest of the gang had all been murdered by the end of 1987 . in 1992 lee was killed by police during a heist at melbourne airport . lee 's lawyer phillip dunn , &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , later revealed the details of the crime , including the identities of all those involved . as &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; was ever jailed or convicted , the great bookie robbery remains technically an unsolved crime .
