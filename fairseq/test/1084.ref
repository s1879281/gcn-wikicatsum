bed and &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; ( russian : &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; ) is the english name of a 1927 soviet silent film originally released in the soviet union as &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , and is sometimes referred to as the third &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; . in addition to the title , bed and &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; it was also released outside of the soviet union under the alternate titles of three in a cellar , old &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , and &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; of moscow . the film gets its russian title from the street on which the main characters live , third &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; street . directed by abram room and written by room and viktor &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , the film starred nikolai &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; as the husband , &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , lyudmila &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; as the wife , &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , and vladimir fogel as the friend , &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; . billed as a satire and comedy , bed and &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; nonetheless portrayed the realities of the moscow working poor , while also dealing with &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; sexual situations such as polygamy and abortion . it was originally banned in both the united states and europe due to those stark sexual situations . the screenplay was supposedly based on the true love story of the acclaimed russian poet vladimir &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; who lived with his " muse " &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; and her husband &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; for some years . the characters themselves also resembled the trio , with vladimir fogel as &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , lyudmila &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; as &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; and nikolai &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; as &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; . the parallels were so obvious that some critics and associates accused viktor &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; of &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; . &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; himself never openly admitted it , yet in his diaries he mentions that during the work on the screenplay they « were living next to &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; » , which is an obvious hint . while movies made in the ussr would soon be regulated to the ideals of soviet realism , some films at this time were able to present &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; themes . even so , bed and &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; was controversial at the time of release in the soviet union , due to its focus on human relationships , while the state and the party are almost completely disregarded . in fact , at one point &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; even declines to go to a party meeting . in addition , the film 's resolution is ambiguous and comes about without any input from the collective . however , it is now considered a landmark film because of humor , &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , and its sympathetic portrayal of the woman .
