black swan is a 2010 american psychological thriller film about a ballet dancer directed by darren aronofsky and starring natalie portman , vincent cassel , and mila kunis . after the 83rd academy awards , in which portman won the oscar for best actress for her role in the film as a ballerina , controversy arose over how much credit for the dancing in the film was being given to her and how much to her " dance double " , american ballet theatre soloist sarah lane . in a march 3 , 2011 blog post ( written prior to the dvd release ) for dance magazine , its editor-in-chief wendy &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; asked why a visual effects video clip showing lane 's face being replaced by portman 's was once available online but later removed from the internet prior to the oscars . she also speculated as to whether portman 's &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; of lane 's name during her acceptance speech was a case of " &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; in the heat of the moment ? or was this &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , and the &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; from the video , planned by the studio 's publicity machine ? " it was also noted that lane is credited as " lady in the lane " and as " stunts " rather than as portman 's double in the theatrical release of the film . this led to a number of responses regarding portman . aronofsky and fox searchlight released a joint statement that argued : " we were &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; to have sarah there to cover the more complicated dance sequences and we have nothing but praise for the hard work she did . however , natalie herself did most of the dancing featured in the final film . " benjamin &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; and kunis also argued in defense of portman 's dancing . lane responded through an essay published in the wall street journal ( portman declined through a representative to write one as well ) and an interview on 20/20 that her interest lies primarily in defense of ballet as an art form that can not be mastered in a year . the dvd of black swan was released on march 29 , 2011 and includes the featurette with sarah lane .
