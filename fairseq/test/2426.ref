the protocols of zion is a 2005 documentary film by jewish filmmaker marc levin about a resurgence of antisemitism in the united states in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks . appearing on screen along with his subjects , levin engages in a &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; dialogue with arab americans , black nationalists , &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , white nationalists , &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; rabbis , holocaust survivors , and frank &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , the founder of the jew watch web site . levin 's film draws its inspiration from an encounter he had in a new york taxi not long after 9/11 , in which his driver , an egyptian immigrant , made the claim that the jews had been warned not to go to work at the world trade center on the day of the attack . he then said that " it 's all written in the book , " referring to the protocols of the elders of zion , a 1903 book purporting to &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; the jews ' master plan to rule the world . discredited as a hoax by the times of london in 1921 , the protocols provided a crucial influence on hitler 's world views , and had &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; hatred , violence , and ultimately genocide attempts through the first half of the twentieth century . ads for the film show two &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; of books , &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; entitled protocols of zion , with smoke &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; out of the top portion of the &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; stack . this looks much like actual pictures of the world trade center as the fire &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; through it . the movie was made in 2005 , four years after the &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; attack .
