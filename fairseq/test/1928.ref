my own private idaho is a 1991 american independent adventure drama film written and directed by gus van sant , loosely based on shakespeare 's henry iv , part 1 , henry iv , part 2 , and henry v , and starring river phoenix and keanu reeves . the story follows two friends , mike and scott , as they embark on a journey of personal discovery that takes them to mike 's hometown in idaho and then to italy in search of mike 's mother . van sant originally wrote the screenplay in the 1970s , but discarded it after reading john &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; 's 1963 novel city of night and concluding that &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; 's treatment of the subject of street hustlers was better than his own . over the years , van sant rewrote the script , which comprised two stories : that of mike and the search for his mother , and scott 's story as a modern update of the henry iv plays . van sant had difficulty getting hollywood financing , and at one point considered making the film on a minuscule budget with a cast of actual street kids . after van sant sent copies of his script to reeves and then reeves showed it to phoenix , both agreed to star in the film on each other 's behalf . my own private idaho had its premiere at the 48th venice international film festival , and received largely positive reviews from critics including roger ebert and those of the new york times and entertainment weekly . the film was a moderate financial success , grossing over $ &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; million in north america , which was above its estimated budget of $ 2.5 million . phoenix received several awards for his performance in the film , including the volpi cup for best actor at the 1991 venice film festival , best male lead from the independent spirit awards , and best actor from the national society of film critics .
