a low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor . many independent films are made on low budgets , but films made on the mainstream circuit with inexperienced or unknown filmmakers can also have low budgets . many young or first time filmmakers shoot low-budget films to prove their talent before doing bigger productions . many low-budget films that do not gain some form of attention or acclaim are never released in theatres and are often sent straight to retail because of its lack of marketability , look , story , or premise . there is no precise number to define a low budget production , and it is relative to both genre and country . what might be a low-budget film in one country may be a big budget in another . modern-day young filmmakers rely on film festivals for pre promotion . they use this to gain acclaim and attention for their films , which often leads to a limited release in theatres . film that acquire a cult following may be given a wide release . low-budget films can be either professional productions or amateur . they are either shot using professional or consumer equipment . some genres are more &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; to low-budget filmmaking than others . horror films are a very popular genre for low-budget directorial debuts . jeremy gardner , director of the battery says that horror fans are more attracted to how the films affect them than seeing movie stars . this allows horror films to focus more on provoking a reaction than on expensive casting choices . thriller films are also a popular choice for low-budget films , as they focus on narrative . science fiction films , which were once the domain of b movies , frequently require a big budget to accommodate their special effects , but low-cost do-it-yourself computer-generated imagery can make them affordable , especially when they focus on story and characterization . plot devices like shooting as found footage can lower production costs , and scripts that rely on extended dialogue , such as reservoir dogs or sex , lies , and videotape , can entertain audiences without many sets . the money flow in filmmaking is a unique system because of the uncertainty of demand . the makers of the film do not know how well the film they release will be received . they may predict a film will do very well and pay back the cost of production , but only get a portion back . or the opposite may happen where a project that few think will go far can bring in more profit than &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; . a big gambling variable that is also involved is the use of stars . frequently stars are brought on to a project to gain the film publicity and fame . this process can be profitable , but it is not a foolproof mechanism to successful funding . well-known actors may join a low-budget film for a portion of the gross .
