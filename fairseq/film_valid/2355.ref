deranged is a canadian-american horror film made in 1974 and directed by alan ormsby and jeff gillen .   it is also known by the title deranged : the confessions of a necrophile in the usa .   it is a low-budget movie that has since become something of a cult film and is based on the life of ed gein .   the title is , however , misleading since ed gein never experimented with necrophilia ; although a necrophile is also defined as " an obsessive fascination with death and corpses . "   the movie disappeared after its release in 1974 and was later rediscovered in florida in the mid 1990s .
