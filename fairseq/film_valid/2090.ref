santo vs. las mujeres vampiro ( also known as samson vs. the vampire women ) is a 1962 horror film starring the wrestling superhero santo .   the film was featured on a 1995 episode of mystery science theater 3000 .   the film was also featured on the television show cinema insomnia .   it is santo 's best-known movie outside of mexico , and is also considered one of his best .   its production values are better than many of his earlier films , and there was an attempt at creating more of a mythos and background for santo , as the last of a long line of superheroes .   it was an enormous success at the box office .   only four of the 52 santo films were ever dubbed into english , the other 48 being only available in spanish .   the english-dubbed mexican films of that time period were imported to the united states through the efforts of k. gordon murray who changed the name of santo to " samson " for some of his releases .   most of murray 's imported mexi-films went directly to late-night american tv .   the " what culture " website summarized it thus : " vampire women emerged during a peak in popularity for horror films in mexico , so the film takes visual cues from the universal and hammer dracula pictures and even throws in a professor in the peter cushing mold .   he ’s not the hero , of course , just a supporting character who recruits santo to save his daughter from an army of vampires .   in common with the hammer films of the time , the female vampires are all astonishingly beautiful , yet the men are about as far removed from christopher lee as it ’s possible to get .   impossibly muscular and about 100 years too contemporary to be believable , the actors look ill at ease in their cheap rubber capes and do n’t really come into their own until they attempt to take santo in a headlock .
