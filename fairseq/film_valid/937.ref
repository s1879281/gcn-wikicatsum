the exodus decoded is a documentary film aired on april 16 , 2006 , on the history channel .   the program was created by israeli-canadian filmmaker simcha jacobovici and the producer/director james cameron .   ( the two would later work together on the lost tomb of jesus . ) the documentary explores evidence for the biblical account of the exodus .   its claims and methods were criticized by biblical scholars and mainstream scientists .   jacobovici suggests that the exodus took place around 1500 bc , during the reign of pharaoh ahmose i , and that it coincided with the minoan eruption .   in the documentary , the plagues that ravaged egypt in the bible are explained as having resulted from that eruption and a related limnic eruption in the nile delta , similar to what occurred in the 1980s at lake nyos in cameroon .   while much of jacobovici 's archaeological evidence for the exodus comes from egypt , some comes from mycenae on mainland greece , such as a gold ornament that somewhat resembles the ark of the covenant .   the documentary makes extensive use of computer animation and visual effects made by gravity visual effects , inc. , based in toronto .   it runs for 90 minutes and was first aired in canada on april 16 , ( easter day ) 2006 ( discovery channel canada ) .   shown in the us on august 20 , 2006 ( history channel us ) , uk on december 23 , 2006 ( discovery channel uk ) , spain on december 25 , 2006 ( cuatro ) and israel on april 3 , 2007 ( channel 2 ) .
