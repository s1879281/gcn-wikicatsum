porklips now is a short , low budget parody film , made in 1980 by the american director ernie fosselius , based on the 1979 motion picture apocalypse now .   it chronicles the journey of dullard ( played by william " billy " gray , most famous as " bud " in the father knows best tv series ) , a gardener and handyman , sent to chinatown by two butchers to meet a business rival , fred " madman " mertz , and " take care of business " .   the film cleverly and humorously incorporates references to signature elements of the film on which it is based , albeit in a somewhat conspicuously low-budget manner .   echoing a widely held if erroneous belief about apocalypse now , the film features several alternate endings .   the film was included on the compilation vhs release hardware wars , and other film farces from warner home video and is currently available on vhs and dvd from pyramid direct films .
