kiss me kate is a 1953 metro-goldwyn-mayer film adaptation of the broadway musical of the same name .   inspired by the taming of the shrew , it tells the tale of musical theater actors , fred graham and lilli vanessi , who were once married and are now performing opposite each other in the roles of petruchio and katherine in a broadway-bound musical version of william shakespeare 's play .   already on poor terms , the pair begin an all-out emotional war mid-performance that threatens the production 's success .   the only thing keeping the show together are threats from a pair of gangsters , who have come to collect a gambling debt from the show 's lucentio , bill calhoun .   in classic musical comedy fashion , slapstick madness ensues before everything is resolved .   dorothy kingsley 's screenplay , which was nominated for a writers guild of america award , was adapted from the musical 's book by samuel and bella spewack .   the songs were by cole porter , with musical underscoring by saul chaplin and andr√© previn , who were nominated for an academy award .   hermes pan choreographed the dance routines .   the movie was filmed in 3-d using the most advanced methods of that technique then available .   devotees of the stereoscopic 3-d medium usually cite this film as one of the best examples of a hollywood release in polarized 3d .
