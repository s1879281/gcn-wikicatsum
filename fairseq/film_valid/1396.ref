the king and the mockingbird ( french : le roi et l'oiseau , literally the king and the bird ) is a 1980 traditionally animated feature film directed by paul grimault .   begun in 1948 as the shepherdess and the chimney sweep ( loosely based on the fairy tale of the same name by hans christian andersen ) , the film was a collaboration between grimault and popular french poet and screenwriter , jacques prévert .   however the film suddenly stopped production and was released unfinished by its producer , without the approval of either grimault or prévert .   through the course of the 1960s and 1970s , grimault obtained the rights to the film and was able to complete a new version as they originally intended .   it was finished over 30 years after it was started .   the film is today regarded as a masterpiece of french animation and has been cited by the japanese directors hayao miyazaki and isao takahata as an influence .   the film has had poor availability in english ( although an english dub exists ) .   while the completed version of the film has not been released on home video in north america , it is available for streaming on amazon instant and vudu .   the first english-friendly release was made in october 2013 in the united kingdom ; it is scheduled for wider theatrical release in the uk in 2014 , with dvd sales from april 2014 .   previously , the film had been often shared by animation fans online .   a low-budget english-language release of the 1952 version , dubbed the curious adventures of mr. wonderbird , is in the public domain and available for free online .   in that version , peter ustinov narrates and voices the main role of the bird .
