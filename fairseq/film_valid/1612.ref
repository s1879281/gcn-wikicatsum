the good german is a 2006 film adaptation of joseph kanon 's eponymous 2001 novel .   it was directed by steven soderbergh , and stars george clooney , cate blanchett , and tobey maguire .   set in berlin following the allied victory over the nazis , it begins as a murder mystery but weaves in elements involving the american postwar employment of nazi rocket scientists in operation paperclip .   the film was shot in black-and-white and is designed to imitate the appearance of film noir from the 1940s , although it also includes material – such as sex scenes and swearing – that would have been prohibited by the production code .   its poster is an homage to the poster for the classic film casablanca ( 1942 , also a warner bros. film ) , as is the closing scene at an airport .   the dvd release presents the film in the 1.33:1 aspect ratio which declined in use from about 1953 , though the theatrical release , and other dvd releases , used the slightly more modern but still unusual 1.66:1 ratio .   the film received mixed reviews and grossed $ 5.9 million worldwide against a budget of $ 32 million .
