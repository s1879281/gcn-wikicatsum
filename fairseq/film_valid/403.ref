the thief is a 1952 american film noir crime film directed by russell rouse and starring ray milland .   it 's the third in a series of six classic film noir productions scripted by rouse and his writing partner clarence greene .   the film is unusual because there is no principal actor dialogue spoken .   the principal characters are not " fleshed-out " , as they might be in a more conventional film , as this film is more about " trade-craft " , not as much about the principal characters and their respective personalities .   not withstanding that observation , the film certainly depends upon the exceptionally strong dramatic performance by ray milland , and the equally strong music performance by composer/conductor herschel burke gilbert .   the film is nearly fully orchestrated by gilbert .
