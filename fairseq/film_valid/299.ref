you were never lovelier is a 1942 hollywood musical romantic comedy film set in buenos aires .   it stars fred astaire and rita hayworth and features adolphe menjou and xavier cugat , with music by jerome kern and lyrics by johnny mercer .   the film was directed by william a. seiter and was released by columbia pictures .   this , the second and last of astaire 's outings with hayworth , avoids wartime themes , and benefits from lavish production values – a consequence of the box-office success of the earlier you 'll never get rich .   kern created a standard with " i 'm old fashioned " .   initially , kern was unhappy about the selection of cugat and his orchestra ; however , when production was complete , he was so pleased with the band 's performance that he presented cugat with a silver baton .   although hayworth had a fine voice , harry cohn insisted on her singing being dubbed throughout by nan wynn .   the film is a reworking of the 1941 argentine musical los martes , orquídeas ( on tuesdays , orchids ) directed by francisco múgica .   it follows the usual conventions established by astaire in his earlier musicals , such as an anti-romantic first meeting between the two leads , a virtuoso dance solo for astaire , a playful dance duet and a romantic dance duet .
