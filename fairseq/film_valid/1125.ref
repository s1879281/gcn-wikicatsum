the fourth war is a 1990 film directed by john frankenheimer , set in west germany of late 1980s .   its title stems from a famous quote by albert einstein : " i can not predict how the third world war shall be fought , or with what ; i can , however , predict that the fourth world war shall be waged with sticks and stones . "   colonel jack knowles ( roy scheider ) is a tough , professional soldier who was decorated for gallantry in vietnam .   however the same gung ho mentality that made knowles a hero in wartime makes him a dangerous loose cannon in peacetime .   he is stationed at an outpost on the west german-czechoslovakia border and immediately gets into a dangerous personal war with his soviet counterpart colonel valachev .   the two men ironically have many of the same characteristics .   knowles is enraged when he has to stand by as a would be refugee is shot on the border and immediately begins crossing the border on dangerous solo missions to sabotage the enemy installations .   knowles comes into conflict with his by the book second-in-command lieutenant colonel clark , and knowles ' superior , general hackworth , angrily orders him to desist , but to no avail .   the petty war between the two men threatens to escalate into a full scale conflict as they engage in hand-to-hand combat on a frozen lake with their countries ' armies on both sides ready to begin a full scale war .   knowles only relents at the last moment to avoid the conflict .
