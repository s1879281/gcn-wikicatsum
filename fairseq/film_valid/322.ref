the voice of the moon ( italian : la voce della luna ) is a 1990 italian dramatic comedy film directed by federico fellini and starring roberto benigni , paolo villaggio , and nadia ottaviani .   returning to themes he first explored in la strada ( 1954 ) , fellini crafts a parable on the whisperings of the soul that only madmen and vagabonds are capable of hearing .   based on the novel il poema dei lunatici by ermano cavazzoni , the film is about a fake inspector of wells and a former prefect who wander through the emilia-romagna countryside of fellini 's childhood and discover a dystopia of television commercials , fascism , beauty pageants , rock music , catholicism , and pagan ritual .   the film received david di donatello awards for best actor , best editing , and best production design , and nominations for best director , best film , best cinematography , best music , and best producer .   the voice of the moon was fellini 's last film before his death in 1993 .
