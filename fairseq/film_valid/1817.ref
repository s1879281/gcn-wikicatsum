everything 's cool is a 2007 documentary film that examines the divide between scientists and the general populace on the topic of global warming .   director dan gold said of the motivation for the film that " i 'm optimistic that finally the message that this is real , that human beings are the cause of the most recent warming trend , and that it 's an important issue , that message is actually reaching america .   on the other hand ... if that message was fully understood , we would be moving a lot faster to slow this down and to reverse this course . "   the documentary was shown at the sundance film festival in january 2007 and at the san francisco international film festival in may 2007 .   the directors also took blue vinyl , a film about plastic pollution , to sundance in 2002 .   it was shown on cbc in canada as part of the passionate eye series .   the new york times called it " a breezy polemic about the politics of global warming ... [ that ] adopts a cheerful comic tone to avoid scaring audiences . "   the la times said that " with wit and passion , gold and helfand marshal a plethora of data and developments yet never lose their narrative thread . " .   the new york sun was less favourable , calling it " the best movie i 've ever seen about global warming for kids in junior high school , but it 's the most annoying movie about global warming i 've ever seen for adults .
