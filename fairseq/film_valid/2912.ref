suzhou river ( chinese : 苏州河 ; pinyin : sūzhōu hé ) is a 2000 film by lou ye about a tragic love story set in contemporary shanghai .   the film , though stylistically distinct , is typical of " sixth generation " chinese filmmakers in its subject matter of contemporary china 's gritty urban experience .   the film stars zhou xun in a dual role as two different women and jia hongsheng as a man obsessed with finding a woman from his past .   the film was co-produced by the german essential films and china 's dream factory .   writer-director lou ye 's second film , suzhou river takes as its background the chaotically built-up riverside architecture of factory buildings and abandoned warehouses along the suzhou river , rather than the glitzy new face of shanghai .   though well-received abroad , suzhou river was not screened in its native china , as lou ye was banned from filmmaking for two years after screening his film at the international film festival rotterdam without permission from chinese authorities .   the movie is now authorized in china .
