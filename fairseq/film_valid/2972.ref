the reenactment ( romanian : ' reconstituirea ' ) , also known as reconstruction , is a 1968 black-and-white film by romanian director lucian pintilie .   it is based on a novel by horia pătraşcu , which in turn reflects real-life events witnessed by the author .   produced under the communist regime , which it indirectly criticizes , it is a tragicomedy about incompetence , indifference and misuse of power .   structured as a film within a film and largely shot as a mockumentary , the reenactment stars george constantin as a prosecutor who keeps in custody two minor delinquents , vuică and nicu , played respectively by george mihăiţă and vladimir găitan .   he makes them reenact their drunken brawl at a restaurant , and is helped in this effort by the militiaman dumitrescu ( played by ernest maftei ) and a film crew .   two bystanders watch upon the youngsters ' degradation at the hands of the prosecutor .   they are the miss ( domnişoara in the original ) , played by ileana popovici , who is amused by the succession of events , and the pedantic alcoholic paveliu ( emil botta ) .   the recipient of much critical acclaim and considered in retrospect one of the most notable contributions to 1960s romanian cinema , the reenactment was released at a time when the communist regime was in its liberalization phase , coinciding with the first decade of rule by nicolae ceauşescu .   nevertheless , its political implications irritated communist officials , and the censorship apparatus decided to withdraw the film from cinemas only months after its premiere .   in 1969 , pintilie was pressured to work outside romania , and focused mainly on stage production for the following twenty years of his career .   the reenactment was again screened at home in 1990 , one year after the romanian revolution toppled communism .
