sthiramati ( sanskrit ; chinese : 安慧tibetan : blo gros brtan pa ) or sāramati was a 6th-century indian buddhist scholar-monk .   he was based primarily in valābhi ( present-day gujarat ) , although he is thought to have spent some time at nālandā .   he was renowned for his numerous and detailed commentaries on yogācāra and abhidharma , works by vasubandhu and others , as well as for a commentary on the kaśyāpa-parivarta .   takasaki is certain that the author of the embedded commentary ( verse and prose ) to the core text ( verse ) of the ratnagotravibhāga [ rgv version as per johnston ] is sāramati through his analysis of the rgv with the dharmadhātvaviśeṣaśāstra .
