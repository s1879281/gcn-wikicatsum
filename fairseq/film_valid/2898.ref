synecdoche , new york is a 2008 american postmodern drama film written and directed by charlie kaufman , and starring philip seymour hoffman .   it is kaufman 's directorial debut .   the plot follows an ailing theatre director ( hoffman ) as he works on an increasingly elaborate stage production whose extreme commitment to realism begins to blur the boundaries between fiction and reality .   the film 's title is a play on schenectady , new york , where much of the film is set , and the concept of synecdoche , wherein a part of something represents the whole , or vice versa .   the film premiered in competition at the 61st annual cannes film festival on may 23 , 2008 .   sony pictures classics acquired the united states distribution rights , paying no money but agreeing to give the film 's backers a portion of the revenues .   it had a limited theatrical release in the u.s. on october 24 , 2008 , and generated much less revenue than it cost .   the story and themes of synecdoche , new york polarized critics : some called it pretentious or " self-indulgent " ; others , including roger ebert , declared it a masterpiece and ranked it among the best films of the 2000s .   it was also nominated for the palme d'or at the 2008 cannes film festival .
