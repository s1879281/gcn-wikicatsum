a slam dunk , also dunk or dunk shot , is a type of basketball shot that is performed when a player jumps in the air , controls the ball ( s ) above the horizontal plane of the rim , and scores by putting the ball directly through the basket with one or both hands .   it is considered a type of field goal ; if successful , it is worth two points .   such a shot was known as a " dunk shot " until the term " slam dunk " was coined by former los angeles lakers announcer chick hearn .   the slam dunk is the most efficient basketball shot . moreover , it is a crowd-pleaser .   thus , the maneuver is often extracted from the basketball game and showcased in slam dunk contests such as the nba slam dunk contest held during the annual nba all-star weekend .   the first incarnation of the nba slam dunk contest was held during the half-time of the 1976 american basketball association all-star game .   dunking was banned in the ncaa from 1967 to 1976 .   many people have attributed this to the dominance of the then-college phenomenon lew alcindor ( now known as kareem abdul-jabbar ) ; the no-dunking rule is sometimes referred to as the " lew alcindor rule . "   the phrase " slam dunk " has entered popular usage in american english outside of its basketball meaning , to refer to a " sure thing " : an action with a guaranteed outcome , or a similarly impressive achievement .   this is related to the high probability of success for a slam dunk versus other types of shots .   this ascension to popular usage is reminiscent of , for example , the way that the baseball-inspired phrases " step up to the plate " and " he hit it out of the park , " or american football-inspired phrases such as " victory formation " or " hail mary " have entered popular north american vernacular .
