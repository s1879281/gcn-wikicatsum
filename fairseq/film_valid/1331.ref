alice is a 1988 dark fantasy film written and directed by jan švankmajer .   its original czech title is něco z alenky , which means " something from alice " .   it is a loose adaptation of lewis carroll 's first alice book , alice 's adventures in wonderland ( 1865 ) , about a girl who follows a white rabbit into a bizarre fantasy land .   alice is played by kristýna kohoutová .   the film combines live action with stop motion animation , and is distinguished by its dark and uncompromising production design .   for švankmajer , a prolific director of short films for more than two decades , alice became his first venture into feature-length filmmaking .   the director had been disappointed by other adaptations of carroll 's book , which interpret it as a fairy tale .   his aim was instead to make the story play out like an amoral dream .   the film won the feature film award at the 1989 annecy international animated film festival .
