ulzana 's raid is a 1972 revisionist western starring burt lancaster , richard jaeckel , bruce davison and joaquin martinez .   the film , which was filmed on location in arizona , was directed by robert aldrich based on a script by alan sharp .   one critic , emanuel levy , wrote : " ulzana 's raid , one of the best westerns of the 1970s , is also one of the most underestimated pictures of vet director robert aldrich , better known for his sci-fi and horror flicks , such as kiss me deadly and what ever happened to baby jane . "   set in 1880s arizona , it portrays a brutal raid by chiricahua apaches against european settlers .   the bleak and nihilistic tone showing u.s. troops chasing an elusive but murderous enemy has been seen as allegorical to the united states participation in the vietnam war .
