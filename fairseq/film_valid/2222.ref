the marriage of figaro ( french : la folle journée , ou le mariage de figaro ( " the mad day , or the marriage of figaro " ) ) is a comedy in five acts , written in 1778 by pierre beaumarchais .   this play is the second in the figaro trilogy , preceded by the barber of seville and followed by the guilty mother .   in the first play , the barber , the story begins with a simple love triangle in which a spanish count has fallen in love with a girl called rosine .   he disguises himself to ensure that she will love him back for his character , not his wealth .   but this is all foiled when rosine 's guardian , doctor bartholo , who wants her hand in marriage , confines her to the house .   the count runs into an ex-servant of his ( now a barber ) , figaro , and pressures him into setting up a meeting between the count and rosine .   he succeeds and the lovers are married to end the first part of the trilogy .   the marriage was written as a sequel to the barber .   in his preface to the play , beaumarchais says that louis françois , prince of conti had requested it .   the play 's denunciation of aristocratic privilege has been characterised as foreshadowing the french revolution .   the revolutionary leader georges danton said that the play " killed off the nobility " ; in exile , napoleon bonaparte called it " the revolution already put into action . "   thanks to the great popularity of its predecessor , the marriage of figaro opened to enormous success ; it was said to have grossed 100,000 francs in the first twenty showings , and the theatre was so packed that three people were reportedly crushed to death in the opening-night crowd .   the play formed the basis for an opera with a libretto by lorenzo da ponte and music by mozart , also called the marriage of figaro ( 1786 ) .   in 1799 , another opera based on the same play , la pazza giornata , ovvero il matrimonio di figaro , was produced in venice with libretto by gaetano rossi and music by marcos portugal .
