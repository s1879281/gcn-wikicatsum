david holzman 's diary is a 1967 american film , directed by jim mcbride , which interrogates the art of documentary-making .   it may be considered a docufiction : paradoxically , despite the film is in fact a false autobiography and documentary , « a fairy tale » , it represents the filmmaker 's life and experience and also the world in which the action takes place with documentary realist techniques .   the mirror metaphor is explicit in the film as code for reality .   it tells the story of a young man making a documentary of his life , who discovers something important about himself while making the movie .   it stars l.m. kit carson , eileen dietz , lorenzo mans and louise levine .   this was mcbride 's directorial debut .   he has since gone on to direct more mainstream work like great balls of fire ! , the big easy , and episodes of television shows such as six feet under and the wonder years .   david holzman 's diary opened in new york city in december ,1973 .   in 1991 , the film was selected for preservation in the united states national film registry by the library of congress as being " culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant " .   a blu-ray release from lorber films was scheduled on august 16 , 2011 .
