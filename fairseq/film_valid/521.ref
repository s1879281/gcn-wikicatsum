dimanche ( english : sunday ) is a canadian animated short film by patrick doyon .   the film debuted at the berlin international film festival in february 2011 and online on january 5 , 2012 .   dimanche is the first professional film by doyon , a native of montreal .   doyon had previously created a three-minute animated short square roots in 2006 , while enrolled in the nfb 's hothouse program for young animators .   still learning how to use computer animation tools , he worked with pen and pencil to create dimanche , hand drawing the entire film .   the 10-minute film took him two years to complete , creating individual drawings on paper , working on a light table .   doyon ended up with 15 boxes full of sheets with sketches , which he then scanned into the computer , colourized and began editing .   doyon believes such traditional animation techniques are better for portraying emotion .
