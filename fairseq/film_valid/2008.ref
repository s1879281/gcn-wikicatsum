growing up is a sex education film for schools , 23 minutes in length , first shown in april 1971 , which was made by dr martin cole .   it is now available as part of the joy of sex education dvd and was described by one critic as " the most famous and controversial inclusion " , and by peter bradshaw of the guardian as the " undoubted masterpiece of this double-dvd set " .   at the time of its release it was said to be " the most explicit and frank film ever made for use in schools " , and attracted condemnation by mary whitehouse , lord longford , margaret thatcher and members of the women 's liberation movement who all , excepting thatcher , attended the first public screening .   made two years before its earliest public showing , cole though soon regretted a traditionalist description of gender roles in the film 's opening commentary .   the function of women was described as " giving birth to children " , while it claimed men were " better at giving birth to ideas " , a sequence which the women 's liberation movement objected to .   there was a version of the film shown to aston university students earlier for feedback prior to the final version being released .   it features scenes rather than drawings of naked people , which included intercourse and masturbation .   teachers and pupils gave it positive feedback , but the absence of a discussion of venereal disease ( vd ) was noted by sympathetic reviewers .   the film triggered a national controversy ; " educationally speaking , it is a rotten film " , whitehouse said after viewing the film , " which makes children no more than animals . "   margaret thatcher , then secretary of state for education who had sent an advisor to view the film , told the house of commons on 21 april that she was " very perturbed " at the thought of the film being shown in schools and suggested local education authorities consider it " with extreme caution " .   after insisting on a screening , the education authority in birmingham , where cole lived , banned the film from being shown in the city 's schools .   there is no record of the film being shown to school children anywhere by the end of 1971 , although it was shown to students at oxford university .
