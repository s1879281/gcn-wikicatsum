the story of g.i. joe , also credited in prints as ernie pyle 's story of g.i. joe , is a 1945 american war film directed by william wellman , starring burgess meredith and robert mitchum .   the film was nominated for four academy awards , including mitchum 's only nomination for best supporting actor .   this was the film that established him as one of the world 's biggest movie stars .   the story is a tribute to the american infantryman ( " g.i. joe " ) during world war ii , told through the eyes of pulitzer prize-winning war correspondent ernie pyle , with dialogue and narration lifted from pyle 's columns .   the film concentrates on one company , ( " c company , 18th infantry " ) , that pyle accompanies into combat in tunisia and italy .   the friendships that grow out of his coverage led pyle to relate the misery and sacrifice inherent in their plight and their heroic endurance of it .   although the company has the designation of an actual unit , that unit did not participate in the combat in italy that makes up the preponderance of the film , and actually stands in for the units of the 34th and 36th infantry divisions that pyle did cover in italy .   the 18th infantry regiment was in italy and n africa with the 1st infantry div .   although filmed with the cooperation of pyle , the film premiered two months to the day after he was killed in action on ie shima during the invasion of okinawa .   in his february 14 , 1945 , posting entitled " in the movies " , pyle commented : " they are still calling it the story of g.i. joe .   i never did like the title , but nobody could think of a better one , and i was too lazy to try .
