hang up your brightest colours is a 1973 film by welsh actor and filmmaker kenneth griffith , about the life and death of irish republican leader michael collins .   it was directed by antony thomas .   although usually classed as a documentary , the film more closely resembles a dramatic monologue , with griffith frequently delivering quotes by key figures such as david lloyd george , winston churchill , and collins himself " in character . "   the film was commissioned by media mogul lew grade for transmission by atv , the itv region covering the midlands he controlled at the time .   grade had , in fact , offered to fund whatever subject griffith wanted to make , but when he viewed the finished film , he refused to show it .   in his memoirs , griffith claimed that grade was unofficially instructed not to offer the film to the iba for network transmission , so that the association would not have to reject it and therefore could be accused of political censorship .   griffith took legal action , received an out-of-court settlement and built his home - michael collins house - in islington with the proceeds .   the film has been described as , " finest of all ( of griffith 's ) drama-docs , " and , " more courageous and incendiary than the later neil jordan movie . "   it was first broadcast on bbc one in wales only in 1993 , and networked across the united kingdom by bbc two the following year .
