that woman opposite ( u.s. city after midnight ) is a 1957 british crime drama , directed by compton bennett and starring phyllis kirk , dan o'herlihy and william franklyn .   the screenplay , also by bennett , was adapted from john dickson carr 's 1942 novel the emperor 's snuff-box .   the film was generally positively received by critics , with picturegoer commenting : " at last , a british thriller with class ... here 's a gloss that usually comes with an import label " .   in a more measured but still approving critique , a radio times reviewer said : " do n't expect too much of this modest film ... and you 'll be agreeably entertained by an efficiently directed work graced by many recognisable faces " .
