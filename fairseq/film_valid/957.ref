venus in furs ( italian : paroxismus - può una morta rivivere per amore ? , german : schwarzer engel ) is a 1969 italian supernatural erotic thriller film directed by jesús franco and starring james darren .   the film ( also known as paroxismus and black angel ) bears only a superficial resemblance to the 1870 venus in furs novel by leopold von sacher-masoch .   the title and character names in franco 's original script were changed to the novel 's for commercial reasons .   franco 's film is a surreal supernatural erotic thriller about unattainable love and how far one is willing to go for the person they desire .   it is not a study in masochism as portrayed in the novel .
