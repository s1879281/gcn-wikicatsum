that 's life ! is a 1986 american comedy-drama film starring jack lemmon and julie andrews , directed by blake edwards .   the film was made independently by edwards using largely his own finances and was distributed by columbia pictures .   although columbia released the film , artisan entertainment , and that company 's successor lionsgate , hold the rights to distribute it on dvd .   that 's life ! was shot in edwards and his wife andrews ' own beachside home in malibu and features their family in small roles , including two daughters .   lemmon 's son chris lemmon plays his character 's son josh , while his wife felicia farr puts in a brief cameo appearance as a fortune teller .   because of the film 's independent status , many of the cast and crew were paid below union-level wages , resulting in the american society of cinematographers picketing the film during production and taking an advertisement in variety in protest .   as a result , the original director of photography , harry stradling jr. , was forced to quit the film and was subsequently replaced by anthony richmond , a british cinematographer .
