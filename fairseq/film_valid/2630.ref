the gothic romance film is a gothic film with feminine appeal .   diane waldman wrote in cinema journal that gothic films in general " permitted the articulation of feminine fear , anger , and distrust of the patriarchal order " and that such films during world war ii and afterward " place an unusual emphasis on the affirmation of feminine perception , interpretation , and lived experience " .   between 1940 and 1948 , the gothic romance film was prevalent in hollywood , being produced by well-known directors and actors .   the best-known films of the era were rebecca ( 1940 ) , suspicion ( 1941 ) , and gaslight ( 1944 ) .   less well-known films were undercurrent ( 1946 ) and sleep , my love ( 1948 ) .   waldman describes these films ' gothic rubric : " a young inexperienced woman meets a handsome older man to whom she is alternately attracted and repelled . "   other films from the decade include the enchanted cottage ( 1945 ) and the heiress ( 1949 ) .   the gothic romance films from the 1940s often contain the " bluebeard motif " , meaning that in the typical setting of the house , a certain part is either forbidden to be used or even closed off entirely .   in the films , the forbidden room is a metaphor for the heroine 's repressed experience , and opening the room is a cathartic moment in the film .   in addition , the layout of the house in such films ( as well as gothic novels ) creates " spatial disorientation [ that ] causes fear and an uncanny restlessness " .   in 2015 , director guillermo del toro released the gothic romance film crimson peak .   he said past films had been " brilliantly written by women and then rendered into films by male directors who reduce the potency of the female characters " .   for crimson peak , he sought to reverse this cinematic trope .
