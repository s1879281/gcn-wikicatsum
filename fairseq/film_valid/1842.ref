battlefield baseball ( 地獄甲子園 jigoku kōshien , " hell stadium " ) is a 2003 japanese film directed by yūdai yamaguchi .   the film is written by gatarō man , based on his manga series of the same name , and stars tak sakaguchi , atsushi itō , and hideo sakaki .   it was produced by ryuhei kitamura .   the film is a combination of several genres , mixing martial arts action with the clichés of the sports film — particularly skewering baseball , one of japan 's most popular high school sports — and the violence and brutality of a horror film .   the film 's bizarre — sometimes almost incoherent — plot , blood and gore , and unique comedy have given it something of a " cult " popularity in the west .   though the film is ostensibly about high school baseball rivalries , the amount of actual baseball in the film is fairly light .   there are many scenes involving bats and balls , however .   the film was released on region 1 dvd by subversive cinema .
