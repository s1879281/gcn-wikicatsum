the kid who could n't miss is a 1983 docudrama film directed by paul cowan .   produced by the national film board of canada , it combines fact and fiction to question fighter pilot billy bishop 's accomplishments during world war i , featuring excerpts from john maclachlan gray 's play billy bishop goes to war .   the film specifically questions accounts of bishop 's solo mission to attack a german aerodrome on june 2 , 1917 , for which he was awarded a victoria cross , and suggests the event was imaginary and that bishop exaggerated his own accomplishments .   in one particularly contentious scene , his mechanic claims that the damage to his fighter was confined to a small circle in a non-critical area , implying that bishop had landed his aircraft off-field , shot the holes in it , and then flown home with claims of combat damage .   in reality , his mechanic was his biggest supporter in this issue and the scene was entirely fictitious .   the mechanic insisted that bishop had not fabricated the damage .
