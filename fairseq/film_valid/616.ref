the last temptation of christ is a 1988 american epic drama film directed by martin scorsese .   written by paul schrader with uncredited rewrites from scorsese and jay cocks , the film is an adaptation of nikos kazantzakis ' controversial 1955 novel of the same name .   the film , starring willem dafoe , harvey keitel , barbara hershey , andre gregory , harry dean stanton and david bowie , was shot entirely in morocco .   like the novel , the film depicts the life of jesus christ and his struggle with various forms of temptation including fear , doubt , depression , reluctance and lust .   this results in the book and film depicting christ being tempted by imagining himself engaged in sexual activities , a notion that has caused outrage from some christians .   the film includes a disclaimer explaining that it departs from the commonly accepted biblical portrayal of jesus 's life and is not based on the gospels .   the film received polarized reviews from critics on its release but scorsese received an academy award nomination for best director .   hershey 's performance as mary magdalene earned her a nomination for the golden globe for best supporting actress .   peter gabriel 's music score also received acclaim , including a nomination for the golden globe award for best original score .
