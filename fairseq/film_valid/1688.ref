where the green ants dream ( german : wo die grünen ameisen träumen ) is a 1984 film by german film director werner herzog .   it was herzog 's first film in english .   based partly on the milirrpum v nabalco pty ltd case and making use of professional actors as well as aboriginal activists who were involved in the case , it was a mix of facts and fiction .   the ant mythology was claimed as herzog 's own , but some natives did consider the green ant as the totem animal that created the world and humans .   wandjuk marika noted that the ant dreaming belief existed in a clan that lived near oenpelli in the northern territory .   the film is set in the australian desert and is about a land feud between a mining company called ayers ( based on nabalco ) and the native aborigines .   the aborigines claim that an area the mining company wishes to work on is the place where green ants dream , and that disturbing them will destroy humanity .   the film was entered in the 1984 cannes film festival .   marika , recommended to herzog by phillip adams , was a leader for the rirratjingu people , an artist and musician who was involved in activism for aboriginal rights .   his didgeridoo music is used in the movie and several members of his family were cast in the film .   the contract with herzog allowed the marikas to make enough money to move from yirrkala to their ancestral region of yalanbara , port bradshaw .   critics of the film found it uncomfortably placed between a documentary and a feature film .   phillip adams was particularly incensed and claimed that the film implied that the australian government was against the aborigines , leading him to write an article titled dammit herzog , you are a liar !
