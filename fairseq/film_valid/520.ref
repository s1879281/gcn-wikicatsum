sacred mountains are central to certain religions and are the subjects of many legends .   for many , the most symbolic aspect of a mountain is the peak because it is believed that it is closest to heaven or other religious worlds .   many religions have traditions centered on sacred mountains , which either are or were considered holy ( such as mount olympus in greek mythology ) or are related to famous events ( like mount sinai in judaism and descendant religions ) .   in some cases , the sacred mountain is purely mythical , like the hara berezaiti in zoroastrianism .   volcanoes , such as mount etna in italy , were also considered sacred .   mount kailash is believed to be the abode of the hindu deity shiva .   mount etna was believed to have been the home of vulcan , the roman god of fire .
