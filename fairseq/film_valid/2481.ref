storytime is a short animated comedy film written , directed and animated by terry gilliam .   it is gilliam 's first film , and stylistically anticipates the distinctive animations which gilliam went on to produce for monty python 's flying circus .   storytime is composed of three loosely connected animated segments .   the first two , " don the cockroach " and " the albert einstein story " , were originally broadcast in the 1971 – 1972 tv series the marty feldman comedy machine , while the third , " the christmas card " , was created for the 1968 christmas special of do not adjust your set .   it is not clear when the three segments were first compiled to create storytime , but the film was eventually included on the jabberwocky dvd as a bonus feature .   it was also shown as an accompaniment to some british theatrical releases of monty python 's life of brian .
