basant bahar , directed by raja nawathe , is an indian classic film of the mid-1950s .   in 1956 , this musical had nine outstanding songs with lyrics written by shailendra and hasrat jaipuri ; and music composition by shankar-jaikishan .   the story is based on the kannada novel " hamsageethe " by legendary novelist tarasu .   " hamasa " means swan and " geethe " means song .   it is believed that before a swan dies , it will sing without opening its mouth .   that mutter of melody is believed to be unmatched since any scene of lyricism falls short of its reach .
