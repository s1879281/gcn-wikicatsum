kalidas ( english : the servant of kali ) , also known as kalidasa , is a 1931 indian tamil-language biographical film directed by h. m. reddy and produced by ardeshir irani .   it is notable for being the first tamil language sound film , and the first sound film to be made in south india .   it was based on the life of the sanskrit poet k훮lid훮sa ; it featured p. g. venkatesan in the title role and t. p. rajalakshmi as the female lead , with l. v. prasad , thevaram rajambal , t. susheela devi , j. sushila , and m. s. santhanalakshmi in supporting roles .   kalidas , principally in tamil , contained additional dialogue in telugu and hindi .   while rajalakshmi spoke tamil , venkatesan spoke only telugu due to his lack of fluency in tamil , and prasad spoke only hindi .   despite its mythological theme , the film featured songs from much later time periods , such as the compositions of carnatic musician tyagaraja , publicity songs of the indian national congress , and songs about mahatma gandhi and the indian independence movement .   the sound was recorded using german-made technology .   kalidas was shot in bombay on the sets of india 's first sound film alam ara ( 1931 ) .   kalidas was released with high expectations on 31 october 1931 , coinciding with diwali day .   it was the only tamil film to be produced and released that year .   despite numerous technical flaws , it received critical acclaim , with praise for rajalakshmi 's singing performance , and it became a major commercial success .   the success of kalidas spawned other films based upon k훮lid훮sa , including mahakavi kalidasa ( 1955 ) , mahakavi kalidasu ( 1960 ) and mahakavi kalidas ( 1966 ) .   in addition to its commercial success , kalidas was a major breakthrough for rajalakshmi 's career , and made her a bankable singing star .   because no print , gramophone record , or songbook of the film is known to survive , it is a lost film .
