kodak high-speed infrared film , also known as kodak hie , was a popular black-and-white infrared photographic film from kodak .   the prominent blooming or " glow " often seen in the highlights of infrared photographs is an artifact of hie and not of infrared light itself ( nor even of all ir-sensitive films ) .   this is because although conventional photographic films have an anti-halation layer that absorbs scattered light , hie lacks this backing .   kodak hie must only be loaded and unloaded in total darkness .   hie features a polyester film base that is very stable but susceptible to scratches , and therefore requires extra care during development , processing and scanning .
