heckler is a 2007 documentary film about hecklers .   the film begins with an examination of the means , methods , and motives of hecklers and their effect on live performances , particularly stand up comedy .   a common observation by professional comics is that hecklers can be categorized in two groups : those who want to participate and sincerely believe they 're helping the comedian , and those who intend to disrupt the comedian .   several male comedians suggest that female hecklers are often motivated by a desire to flirt with the performer .   subsequently , the film segues into a longer examination of film and music critics , including their effect on performers .   the documentary suggests that most critics are motivated by frustrated artistic ambitions , and are no better than hecklers given that internet criticism has emboldened critics to engage in vicious personal attacks rather than critiques of artists ' work .   the film is hosted by actor/comedian jamie kennedy , who was inspired to create the movie after feeling wounded by the overwhelmingly negative reviews for his movie son of the mask ( 2005 ) , some of which attacked kennedy personally rather than reviewing the film .   interviewees include comedians louie anderson , kathy griffin , bobby slayton , patton oswalt , joe rogan , arsenio hall , carrot top , maria bamford and george wallace ; medical doctor drew pinsky ; journalist christopher hitchens ; political commentator dennis prager ; directors peter guber , joel schumacher , george lucas and rob zombie ; and singer jewel kilcher .   heckler also includes footage of much-derided filmmaker uwe boll 's boxing matches with several of his most vocal critics .
