half-cocked is a cult music road movie , made in 1994 in louisville , nashville and chattanooga .   the movie tells the story about a group of high school teens who steal a van full of music equipment and pretend to be a band , called " truckstop " ( played by the band , rodan ) in order to stay on the road .   when the band starts playing gigs , their sound is largely inconsistent and incoherent , however , over time , the band becomes increasingly competent in their musicianship .   the film puts much emphasis on the indie/alternative rock subculture .   many indie rockbands such as polvo , grifters , freakwater , versus , slant 6 , rodan , unwound , helium , sleepyhead , crain , and ruby falls are featured in the movie .   members of rodan and the grifters play in the movie as well as actors .   the movie appeared in a small run on vhs , but is sold out for years and became a collectible item on ebay .   in 2007 , the movie was re-released and has since been available on dvd .   a soundtrack of the movie appeared on matador records .
