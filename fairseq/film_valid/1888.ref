double deal is a 1983 australian film about a bored wife of a rich man who has an affair and becomes a thief .   angela punch mcgregor later said she was " amazed " to be offered the role of a model but accepted the part because she had not worked for a while .   i feared that if i did n't do it i would go down the plug hole the role was a mistake ; the film was a mistake .   but i did n't know that at the time .   brian kavanagh turned out to be one of the most sensitive directors to actors that i have ever come across , but i do n't think he should write his own scripts .   the film was made without government investment .
