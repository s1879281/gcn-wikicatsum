the green man ( isbn 978-0-89733-220-0 ) is a 1969 novel by british author kingsley amis .   a times literary supplement reviewer described the green man as " three genres of novel in one " : ghost story , moral fable , and comic novel .   the novel reflects amis 's willingness to experiment with genre novels ( e.g. , the alteration ( science fiction/alternate history ) , or colonel sun : a james bond adventure ) while displaying many of the characteristics of his conventional novels , both in superficial aspects such as fogeyishness and problems with alcohol , and in more substantive aspects such as a self-reflective observation of human cruelty and selfishness in everyday relations .
