the frighteners is a 1996 new zealand-american fantasy horror comedy film directed by peter jackson and co-written with his wife , fran walsh .   the film stars michael j. fox , trini alvarado , peter dobson , john astin , dee wallace stone , jeffrey combs , r. lee ermey and jake busey .   the frighteners tells the story of frank bannister ( fox ) , an architect who develops psychic abilities allowing him to see , hear , and communicate with ghosts after his wife 's murder .   he initially uses his new abilities to befriend ghosts , whom he sends to haunt people so that he can charge them handsome fees for " exorcising " the ghosts .   however , the spirit of a mass murderer appears able to attack the living and the dead , posing as the grim reaper , prompting frank to investigate the supernatural presence .   jackson and walsh conceived the idea for the frighteners during the script-writing phase of heavenly creatures .   executive producer robert zemeckis hired the duo to write the script , with the original intention of zemeckis directing the frighteners as a spin-off film of the television series , tales from the crypt .   with jackson and walsh 's first draft submitted in january 1994 , zemeckis believed the film would be better off directed by jackson , produced by zemeckis and funded/distributed by universal studios .   the visual effects were created by jackson 's weta digital , which had only been in existence for three years .   this , plus the fact that the frighteners required more digital effects shots than almost any movie made until that time , resulted in the eighteen-month period for effects work by weta digital being largely stressed .   despite a rushed post-production schedule , universal was so impressed with jackson 's rough cut on the frighteners , the studio moved the theatrical release date closer by four months .   the film was not a box office success , but received generally positive reviews from critics .   despite its lackluster performance at the box office , the film has gained a cult following in more recent years .   the frighteners is also fox 's last leading role in a live-action feature film ; fox then went on to a four-year run on the television series spin city before semi-retiring in 2000 due to the effects of parkinson 's disease .
