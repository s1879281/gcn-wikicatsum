the vampire ( also known as mark of the vampire ) is a black-and-white 1957 american horror film produced by arthur gardner and jules v. levy , directed by paul landres , and starring john beal and colleen gray .   like 1956 's the werewolf , it offered a science fiction take on a traditionally supernatural creature , although the films were produced by different production companies .   the film was released theatrically in san francisco on a double bill with the monster that challenged the world , but it did not receive a theatrical run aside from this .   it should be noted that the vampire , due to the use of its alternative title , is now often confused in references with the 1935 mark of the vampire starring bela lugosi .
