outside the law is a 1920 american crime film directed by tod browning and starring lon chaney .   browning would remake the film in 1930 with a pre-little caesar edward g. robinson in chaney 's role as a gang leader .   outside the law is considered to be one of the first psychologically driven films in the gangster genre .   the picture was the second film on which browning worked with lon chaney .   the contrasting dual roles browning wrote for chaney as a heroic chinese servant and an evil gangster are considered to have solidified the long-lasting collaboration between the two .   outside the law is one of only a handful of browning 's films that is not a horror film .   the film has been commended for its strong female lead , saying actress " priscilla dean in this picture is a film revelation ... [ she ] goes to the fore and remains there ... " in contrast to many films of the period , it generally depicts its chinese characters favorably , most notably by having characters invested in the confucian teachings of the teacher character , chang lo .
