incubus ( esperanto : inkubo ) is a 1966 black-and-white american horror film filmed entirely in the constructed language esperanto .   it was directed by leslie stevens , creator of the outer limits , and stars william shatner , shortly before he would begin his work on star trek .   the film 's cinematography was by conrad hall , who went on to win three academy awards for his work on the films butch cassidy and the sundance kid , american beauty and road to perdition .   the use of esperanto was intended to create an eerie , other-worldly feeling , and stevens prohibited dubbing the film into other languages ; however , on the special features section of the dvd the makers claim that esperanto was used because of perceived greater international sales .   incubus was the second feature film primarily using esperanto .   ( the first , angoroj ( " agonies " ) , appeared in 1964 . ) esperanto speakers are generally disappointed by the pronunciation of the language by the cast of incubus .   the film was considered to be lost for many years , until a copy was found in paris in 1996 .
