business war gaming or business wargaming is an adaptation of the art of simulating moves and counter-moves in a commercial setting .   unlike military war games , or fantasy war games which can be set hundreds of years in the past , business war games are usually set in the present and are a relatively recent development , but they are growing rapidly .   the rationale for running a business war game is that it is a tool of particular value when the competitive environment is undergoing a process of change , as it allows decision makers to consider proactively how different players can react to the change , and to each other .   the benefit of teams role playing competitors and developing more robust strategies is especially notable , and can be inferred from a quote such as the one below from richard clark , ceo of merck and co. , who in an interview to usa today said : " i am a strong believer in if you ’re going to develop a vision or a strategic plan for the future of a company that you have to engage the organization in doing that … it ca n’t be just the ceo or top 10 executives sitting in a sterile conference room .
