the two faces of dr. jekyll is a 1960 horror film by hammer film productions .   it was directed by terence fisher , and stars paul massie as dr. jekyll , and co-stars dawn addams , christopher lee and david kossoff .   it was written by wolf mankowitz , based on the 1886 novella strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde by robert louis stevenson .   in contrast to other film versions , jekyll was portrayed as a rather bland and faceless person , while hyde was presented as suave and handsome .   this reflects director fisher 's belief in what critics ( such as biographer wheeler winston dixon ) called " the charm of evil " .   the film is also unusual in that it is one of the few where the jekyll/hyde character does not die in the story 's conclusion .   the film was released in north america to theaters under the titles house of fright and jekyll 's inferno and on american tv under its original british title .
