amphiprion polymnus , also known as the saddleback clownfish or yellowfin anemonefish , is a black and white species of anemonefish with a distinctive saddle .   like all anemonefishes it forms a symbiotic mutualism with sea anemones and is unaffected by the stinging tentacles of the host anemone .   it is a sequential hermaphrodite with a strict sized based dominance hierarchy : the female is largest , the breeding male is second largest , and the male non-breeders get progressively smaller as the hierarchy descends .   they exhibit protandry , meaning the breeding male will change to female if the sole breeding female dies , with the largest non-breeder becomes the breeding male .
