playtime ( sometimes written playtime or play time ) is a 1967 french comedy film directed by jacques tati .   in playtime , tati again plays monsieur hulot , a character who had appeared in his earlier films mon oncle and les vacances de monsieur hulot .   as mentioned on the production documentary that accompanies the criterion collections dvd of the film , by 1964 tati had grown ambivalent towards playing hulot as a recurring central role .   unable to dispense with the popular character altogether , hulot appears intermittently in playtime , alternating between central and supporting roles .   playtime was made from 1964 through 1967 .   shot in 70 mm , the work is notable for its enormous set , which tati had built specially for the film , as well as tati 's trademark use of subtle , yet complex visual comedy supported by creative sound effects ; dialogue is frequently reduced to the level of background noise .   playtime is considered tati 's masterpiece , as well as his most daring work .
