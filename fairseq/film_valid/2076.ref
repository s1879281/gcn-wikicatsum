z is a 1969 algerian-french epic political thriller film directed by costa-gavras , with a screenplay by gavras and jorge semprún , based on the 1966 novel of the same name by vassilis vassilikos .   the film presents a thinly fictionalized account of the events surrounding the assassination of democratic greek politician grigoris lambrakis in 1963 .   with its satirical view of greek politics , its dark sense of humor , and its downbeat ending , the film captures the outrage about the military dictatorship that ruled greece at the time of its making .   the film stars jean-louis trintignant as the investigating magistrate ( an analogue of christos sartzetakis who later served as president of greece from 1985 to 1990 ) .   international stars yves montand and irene papas also appear , but despite their star billing have very little screen time .   jacques perrin , who co-produced , plays a key role as a photojournalist .   the film 's title refers to a popular greek protest slogan ( greek : ζει , ipa : [ ˈzi ] ) meaning " he lives , " in reference to lambrakis .   the film had a total of 3,952,913 admissions in france and was the 4th highest grossing film of the year .   it was also the 12th highest grossing film of 1969 in the u.s. z is also the first film — and one of the few — to be nominated for both the academy award for best foreign language film and best picture .
