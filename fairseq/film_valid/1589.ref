los enchiladas ! is a 1999 film written , directed by and starring stand-up comedian mitch hedberg .   the film is loosely based on his life growing up in minnesota and his experience working in restaurants .   it parodies a chain mexican restaurant in a suburb of st. paul , minnesota , on the day before cinco de mayo ( the busiest day of the year for mexican restaurants ) .   the storyline follows an ensemble cast of absurd characters that work in and visit the restaurant throughout the course of one day .   the cast is composed of many of mitch 's comedian friends and rounded out by local minnesota actors .   three different local restaurants were used to portray the film 's restaurant ; one for the dining room scenes , a second for the kitchen scenes , and a third for the outside of the restaurant , which was a chi-chi 's that mitch actually worked at many years before and was the main inspiration for the ridiculously inauthentic los enchiladas .   " los enchiladas ! "   premiered at the 1999 sundance film festival , and has only been shown publicly a handful of times since , at comedy festivals and tributes to the deceased director , such as the one at the paramount theatre in anderson , indiana on august 12 , 2010 .   it has never been publicly released for purchase or download , although mitch 's fanbase has expressed a continuing desire for the film to become available .   in april 2011 , an unofficial workprint copy was released on various torrent and p2p sites .
