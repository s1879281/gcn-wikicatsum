a bucket of blood is a 1959 american black comedy horror film directed by roger corman .   it starred dick miller and was set in beatnik culture .   the film , produced on a $ 50,000 budget , was shot in five days and shares many of the low-budget filmmaking aesthetics commonly associated with corman 's work .   written by charles b. griffith , the film is a dark comic satire about a dimwitted , impressionable young busboy at a bohemian caf√© who is acclaimed as a brilliant sculptor when he accidentally kills his landlady 's cat and covers its body in clay to hide the evidence .   when he is pressured to create similar work , he becomes murderous .   a bucket of blood was the first of three collaborations between corman and griffith in the comedy genre , followed by the little shop of horrors ( which was shot on the same sets as a bucket of blood ) and creature from the haunted sea .   corman had made no previous attempt at the genre , although past and future corman productions in other genres incorporated comedic elements .   the film is a satire not only of corman 's own films but also of the art world and teen films of the 1950s .   the film is noted as well in many circles as an honest , undiscriminating portrayal of the many facets of beatnik culture , including art , dance and style of living .   the plot has similarities to mystery of the wax museum ( 1933 ) .   however , by setting the story in the beat milieu of 1950s southern california , corman creates an entirely different mood from the earlier film .
