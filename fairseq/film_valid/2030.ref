white dog is a 1982 american drama film , which samuel fuller directed from a screenplay he and curtis hanson had dramatized , which , in turn , they based loosely on romain gary 's 1970 novel of the same title .   the film depicts the struggle of a dog trainer named keys ( paul winfield ) , who is black , trying to retrain a stray dog found by a young actress ( kristy mcnichol ) , that is a " white dog " -- a dog trained to make vicious attacks upon , and to murder , any black person .   fuller uses the film as a platform to deliver an anti-racist message as it examines the question of whether racism is a treatable problem or an incurable condition .   the film 's theatrical release was suppressed after a week in the united states by paramount pictures out of concern of negative press after rumors began circulating that the film was racist .   prior to the date , it was released internationally in france in july 1982 .   its first official american home video release came in december 2008 when the criterion collection released the original uncut film to dvd .   critics praised the film 's hard-line look at racism and fuller 's use of melodrama and metaphors to present his argument , and its somewhat disheartening ending that leaves the impression that while racism is learned , it can not be cured .   reviewers consistently questioned the film 's lack of wide release in the united states when it was completed and applauded its belated release by criterion .
