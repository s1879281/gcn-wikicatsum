daddy long legs ( 1955 ) is a hollywood musical comedy film set in france , new york city , and the fictional college town of walston , massachusetts .   the film was directed by jean negulesco , and stars fred astaire , leslie caron , terry moore , fred clark , and thelma ritter , with music and lyrics by johnny mercer .   the screenplay was written by phoebe ephron and henry ephron , loosely based on the 1912 novel daddy-long-legs by jean webster .   daddy long legs was fred astaire 's only movie musical at 20th century-fox .   it was also the only time he co-starred with leslie caron ( who , at the time , was still under contract to metro-goldwyn-mayer , but was lent to fox for this production ) .   the film was one of astaire 's personal favorites , largely due to the script , which , for once , directly addresses the complications inherent in a love affair between a young woman and a man thirty years her senior .   however , the making of it was marred by his wife 's death from lung cancer .   a devastated astaire offered to pay the production expenses already incurred in order to quit the project , but then changed his mind .   this was the first of three consecutive astaire films set in france or with a french theme ( the others being funny face and silk stockings ) , following the fashion for french-themed musicals established by ardent francophile gene kelly with an american in paris ( 1951 ) , which also featured kelly 's protégée caron .   like the band wagon , daddy long legs did only moderately well at the box office .
