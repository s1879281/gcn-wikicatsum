no , no , nanette is a musical comedy with lyrics by irving caesar and otto harbach , music by vincent youmans , and a book by otto harbach and frank mandel , based on mandel 's 1919 broadway play my lady friends .   the farcical story involves three couples who find themselves together at a cottage in atlantic city in the midst of a blackmail scheme , focusing on a young , fun-loving manhattan heiress who naughtily runs off for a weekend , leaving her unhappy fianc√© .   its songs include the well-known " tea for two " and " i want to be happy " .   during its 1924 pre-broadway tour , no , no , nanette became a hit in chicago , and the production stayed there for over a year .   in 1925 , the show opened both on broadway and in the west end , running 321 and 665 performances respectively . film versions and revivals followed .   a popular 1971 broadway revival , with a book adapted by burt shevelove , led to the piece becoming a favorite of school and community groups for a time .   a popular myth held that the show was financed by selling baseball superstar babe ruth to the new york yankees , resulting in the " curse of the bambino . "   however , it was my lady friends , rather than no , no , nanette , that was directly financed by the ruth sale .
