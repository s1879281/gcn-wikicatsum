"   an irish times writer called the programme a " landmark " ( albeit a " bizarrely underpromoted " one ) .   the program won a peabody award in 2013 " for its inclusive , uniquely annotated survey of world cinema history . "   in february 2012 , a. o. scott of the new york times described cousins ' film as " a semester-long film studies survey course compressed into 15 brisk , sometimes contentious hours " that " stands as an invigorated compendium of conventional wisdom . "   contrasting the project with its " important precursor ( and also , perhaps , an implicit interlocutor ) " , jean-luc godard ’s histoire ( s ) du cinéma , scott commended cousins ' film as " the place from which all future revisionism must start " .   it might be considered one of the most insightful , complete and objective documentary related to movies from all over the world .
