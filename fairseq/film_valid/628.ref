misery me is a 1959 australian television movie , or rather a live television play , which aired on abc .   it was a satirical comedy written by british playwright dennis cannan and had originally been a stage play .   at the time , most tv plays presented on australian television were adaptations of overseas stage plays .   it is likely that the experience gained from these productions allowed abc to later produce dramatic programs with more local interest , such as stormy petrel .   the program was originally shown in sydney ( on abn-2 ) on 15 july 1959 .   a kinescope ( " telerecording " ) was made of the program and later shown in melbourne on 5 august 1959 ( on abv-2 ) .   in 1959 , two additional abc stations began operations , in adelaide and brisbane respectively , and it is not known of the program was also shown in these two cities .   the archival status of the program is not known .
