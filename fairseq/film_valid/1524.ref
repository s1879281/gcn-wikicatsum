scotland , pa is a 2001 film directed and written by william morrissette .   it is a modernized version of william shakespeare 's macbeth .   the film stars james legros , maura tierney , and christopher walken .   shakespeare 's tragedy , originally set in dunsinane castle in 11th century scotland , is reworked into a dark comedy set in 1975 , centered on " duncan 's cafe " , a fast-food restaurant in the small town of scotland , pennsylvania .   the choice of pennsylvania is arbitrary , though it coincides with two real towns , one southwest of harrisburg on the outskirts of chambersburg called scotland and one just south of erie , called edinboro after scotland 's edinburgh .   the film was shot in nova scotia .   the character of macbeth is presented as " joe ' mac ' mcbeth " ( legros ) , lady macbeth as " pat mcbeth " ( tierney ) , duncan as cafe owner " norm duncan " ( james rebhorn ) , macduff as " lieutenant ernie mcduff " ( walken ) , and banquo as fry cook " anthony ' banko ' banconi " ( kevin corrigan ) .   the three witches are presented as a trio of bohemians ( amy smart , timothy " speed " levitch , and andy dick ) .   the film was nominated for the grand jury prize at the sundance film festival in 2001 .   the soundtrack is made up of bad company songs because , in morrissette 's words , " the band 's catalogue was surprisingly inexpensive " .
