just another day is a short film by the palestinian visual artist and filmmaker hisham zreiq ( zrake ) .   the film deals with post 9/11 status of arabs in the western world , via the story of a young arab man that lives in europe after the september 11 terror attacks .   the story is told in a day when his city is struck by another terror attack , in a sad chapter of his life , because he is suffering after the woman he loves left him â€“ precisely because he is an arab .
