macbeth is a silent , black-and-white 1916 film adaptation of the william shakespeare play macbeth .   it was directed by john emerson , assisted by erich von stroheim , and produced by d. w. griffith , with cinematography by victor fleming .   the film starred herbert beerbohm tree and constance collier , both famous from the stage and for playing shakespearean parts .   although released during the first decade of feature filmmaking , it was already the seventh version of macbeth to be produced , one of eight of the silent film era .   it is considered to be a lost film .   the running time is 80 minutes .   in the companion book to his hollywood television series , kevin brownlow states that sir herbert tree failed to understand that the production was a silent film and that speech was not needed so much as pantomime .   tree , who had performed the play numerous times on the stage , kept spouting reams of dialogue .   so emerson and fleming simply removed the film and cranked an empty camera so as not to waste film when he did so .
