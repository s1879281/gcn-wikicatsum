a digital backlot ( also known as a virtual backlot ) is a motion picture set that is neither a genuine location nor a constructed studio ; the shooting takes place entirely on a stage with a blank background ( often a greenscreen ) that will later on project an artificial environment put in during post-production .   digital backlot is more often used in certain genre of films , like sci-fi and comics , in order to achieve what would otherwise be too expensive or outright impossible to build as a real set .
