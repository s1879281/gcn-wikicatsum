a zwicker tone is a short-term auditory illusion which resembles tinnitus ( ringing of the ears ) .   it was discovered in 1964 by eberhard zwicker at bell labs .   the zwicker tone can be described as follows : while listening to broadband noise ( " white noise " ) with a spectral gap , if it is switched off a faint tone lasting for several seconds can be heard .   in the silence , most listeners hear a tone corresponding to the spectral gap .   the pitch strength corresponds to the pitch strength of a pure tone of same pitch and sensation level .
