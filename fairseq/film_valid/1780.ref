the international building code ( ibc ) is a model building code developed by the international code council ( icc ) .   it has been adopted for use as a base code standard by most jurisdictions in the united states .   elsewhere , it is also used in abu dhabi , the caribbean community , colombia , georgia , honduras , and saudi arabia .   the ibc addresses both health and safety concerns for buildings based upon prescriptive and performance related requirements .   the ibc is fully compatible with all other published icc codes .   the code provisions are intended to protect public health and safety while avoiding both unnecessary costs and preferential treatment of specific materials or methods of construction .
