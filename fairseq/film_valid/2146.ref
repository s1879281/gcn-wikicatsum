coogan 's bluff is a 1968 american action film directed by don siegel , and starring clint eastwood , lee j. cobb , don stroud and susan clark .   the film marks the first of five collaborations between siegel and eastwood , which continued with two mules for sister sara ( 1970 ) , the beguiled and dirty harry ( both 1971 ) , and finally escape from alcatraz ( 1979 ) .   eastwood plays the part of a veteran deputy sheriff from a rural county in arizona who travels to new york city to extradite an apprehended fugitive named jimmy ringerman , played by stroud , who is wanted for murder .   the name of the film itself is a reference to a new york city natural landmark , coogan 's bluff , a promontory in upper manhattan overlooking the site of the former long-time home of the new york giants baseball club , the polo grounds , with a double-meaning derived from the name of the lead character .   the television series mccloud , starring dennis weaver , was loosely adapted from this movie .
