tales from the crypt is a 1972 british horror film , directed by freddie francis .   it is an anthology film consisting of five separate segments , based on stories from ec comics .   only two of the stories , however , are actually from ec 's tales from the crypt .   the reason for this , according to creepy founding editor russ jones , is that producer milton subotsky did not own a run of the original ec comic book but instead adapted the movie from the two paperback reprints given to him by jones .   the movie was one of many amicus horror anthologies made during the 1970s and features an all star cast , including joan collins , peter cushing , richard greene , and roy dotrice , with ralph richardson as the crypt keeper .   the story wish you were here was reprinted in the paperback collection the vault of horror ( ballantine , 1965 ) .   the other four stories in the movie were among the eight stories reprinted in tales from the crypt ( ballantine , 1964 ) .   it was produced by amicus productions and filmed at shepperton studios .   in the film , five strangers ( joan collins , ian hendry , robin phillips , richard greene , and nigel patrick ) encounter the mysterious crypt keeper ( ralph richardson ) in a crypt , and he tells each in turn the manner of their death .   richardson 's hooded crypt keeper , more sombre than the ec original ( as illustrated by al feldstein and jack davis ) , has a monk-like appearance and resembles ec 's ghoulunatics .   in the ec horror comics , the other horror hosts ( the old witch and the vault keeper ) wore hoods , while the crypt keeper did not .   the screenplay was adapted into a tie-in novel by jack oleck , tales from the crypt ( bantam , 1972 ) .   oleck , who wrote the novel messalina ( 1950 ) , also scripted for ec 's picto-fiction titles , crime illustrated , shock illustrated and terror illustrated .   a sequel , the vault of horror , with a tie-in also written by oleck , was released in 1973 .
