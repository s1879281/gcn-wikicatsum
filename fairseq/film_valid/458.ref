the burgerlijk wetboek ( or bw ) is the civil code of the netherlands .   early versions were largely based on the napoleonic code .   the dutch civil code was substantively reformed in 1992 .   the code deals with the rights of natural persons ( book 1 ) , legal persons ( book 2 ) , patrimony ( book 3 ) and succession ( book 4 ) .   it also sets out the law of property ( e.g. , ownership , possession , and security interests ) ( book 5 ) , obligations and contracts ( books 6-7 ) , and conflict of laws ( book 10 ) .   proposed amendments will add a book on intellectual property .   the codification of laws is still being used in indonesia as a pinnacle of the private laws besides sharia law and custom laws .   the laws initially applied only to dutch settlers and foreign traders such as chinese traders , indian traders and arab traders during the dutch colonial era in dutch east indies , but after the independence of indonesia in 1945 , the government decided to retain the old dutch law , expanded in use to indigenous people and moslems voluntarily .   the 1992 reformed version does not apply in indonesia .
