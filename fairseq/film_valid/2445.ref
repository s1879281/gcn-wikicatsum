kill your darlings is a 2006 film directed by björne larson and written by björne larson and johan sandström .   in an interview with svenska dagbladet , larson said that the film is based on a real event in his life when he met a seemingly nice man at an internet cafe in los angeles who ended up leaving larson bound and restrained in a desert .   the film features a cast of many of the most popular contemporary swedish actors ( fares fares , father and son stellan and alexander skarsgård , and andreas wilson from oscar-nominated evil ) and some less famous u.s. actors julie benz and greg germann , and canadian lolita davidovitch .   the title seems to be a reference to the popular advice for writers , " murder your darlings , " commonly misattributed but written by sir arthur quiller-couch .
