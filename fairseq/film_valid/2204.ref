min and bill is a 1930 american pre-code comedy-drama film starring marie dressler and wallace beery and based on lorna moon 's novel dark star , adapted by frances marion and marion jackson .   the film tells the story of dockside innkeeper min 's tribulations as she tries to protect the innocence of her adopted daughter nancy , all while loving and fighting with boozy fisherman bill , who resides at the inn .   min and bill stars marie dressler ( min ) , wallace beery ( bill ) , dorothy jordan ( nancy ) , and marjorie rambeau ( bella , nancy 's ill-reputed mother ) , and was directed by george w. hill .   dressler won the academy award for best actress in 1931 for her performance in this film .   this film was such a runaway hit that it and its near-sequel tugboat annie , which reteamed dressler and beery in similar roles , boosted both to superstar status .   dressler topped quigley publications ' annual top ten money making stars poll of movie exhibitors in 1933 , and the two pairings with dressler were primarily responsible for beery becoming mgm 's highest paid actor in the early 1930s , before clark gable took over that crown ; beery had a clause in his 1932 contract that he be paid a dollar per year more than any other actor on the lot .
