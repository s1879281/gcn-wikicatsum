the naked brothers band is a 2005 american children 's film written and directed by polly draper , which stars her sons , nat wolff and alex wolff , who portray members of a fictional rock group .   it tells of the boys ' struggles with their fame and an internal dispute that causes the band to split before reuniting in the end .   the musical comedy was emboldened by nat 's genuine band , the silver boulders , which he created in preschool with his friends who all portray themselves .   the movie also includes the band 's manager , nat 's faux female interest , the siblings ' real life cousin as the group 's babysitter , and the siblings ' genuine father playing their inept accordion-playing dad .   draper shot the film in the style of a mockumentary — a parody in documentary format — that depicts the daily activities of the characters .   nat composed and performed the music , yet one song had been written by alex. principal photography took place in mid-2004 on location in new york city , and the interior scenes were vastly filmed in the family 's manhattan apartment .   draper 's brother , tim , a venture capitalist , provided financial incentives for the shoot .   in late 2005 , polly draper , known for her role in thirtysomething , and her jazz musician husband michael wolff entered the film at the hamptons international film festival , where it won the audience award for a family feature film .   albie hecht , the former president of nickelodeon , was in the audience and purchased the movie , in affiliation with his worldwide biggies label .   it became the pilot for the subsequent nickelodeon show of the same name , airing in the united states on january 27 , 2007 .   the series was created by draper and premiered in february 2007 , to the channel 's highest ratings in seven years for viewers in the 6 – 11 age group .
