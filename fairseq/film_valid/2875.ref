the augustas ( filmed in the early 1930s and the late 1940s ) is a home movie made by scott nixon , an avid member of the amateur cinema league and a traveling salesman based in augusta , georgia who enjoyed recording his travels on film .   in this 16-minute silent film , nixon documents some 38 streets , storefronts and cities named augusta in such far-flung locales as montana and maine .   arranged with no apparent rhyme or reason , the film strings together brief snapshots of these augustas , many of which are indicated at the point of a pencil on a train timetable or road map .   nixon photographed his odyssey using both 8 mm and 16 mm movie cameras loaded with black-and-white and color motion picture film stock , amassing 26,000 feet of film that now resides at the university of south carolina .   while nixon ’s film does not illuminate the historical or present-day significance of these towns , it binds them together under the umbrella of americana .   whether intentionally or coincidentally , this amateur auteur seems to juxtapose the name ’s lofty origin — ‘ august , ’ meaning great or venerable — with the unspectacular nature of everyday life in small-town america .
