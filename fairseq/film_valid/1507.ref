toni is a 1935 french drama film directed by jean renoir and starring charles blavette , celia montalván and édouard delmont .   it is an early example of the casting of non-professional actors and on-location shooting - both of which would influence the left bank of the french new wave movement .   examining the romantic interactions between a group of immigrants ( both from abroad and other parts of france ) working around a quarry and a farm in provence , it is also generally considered a major precursor to the italian neorealist movement .   luchino visconti , one of the founding members of the later film movement , was assistant director on the film .   it was based out of marcel pagnol 's studios in marseille and shot entirely on location in the south of france .   although toni is not among renoir 's most famous works , it continues to receive positive reviews from critics .
