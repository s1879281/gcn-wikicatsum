friday the 13th part iii is a 1982 american 3d slasher film directed by steve miner and the third installment in the friday the 13th film series .   originally released in 3-d , it is the first film to feature antagonist jason voorhees wearing his signature hockey mask , which has become a trademark of both the character and franchise , as well an icon in american cinema and horror films in general .   as a direct sequel to friday the 13th ( 1980 ) and friday the 13th part 2 ( 1981 ) , the film follows a group of co-eds on vacation at a house on crystal lake , where jason voorhees has taken refuge .   originally , the film was supposed to focus on ginny field , who checked herself into a mental institution after her traumatic battle with jason voorhees in the previous film .   the film would have been similar to halloween ii , with jason voorhees tracking down ginny in the mental hospital similar to how michael myers stalked laurie strode in the sequel .   this concept was abandoned when amy steel declined to reprise her role .   when first released , the film was intended to end the series as a trilogy .   however unlike its sequel friday the 13th part iv : the final chapter ( 1984 ) and the later film , jason goes to hell : the final friday ( 1993 ) , friday the 13th part iii did not include a moniker in its title to indicate it as such .   despite negative reviews from critics , friday the 13th part iii grossed over $ 36.6 million at the us box office on a budget of $ 2.3 million .   the film was the first to remove e.t. : the extra terrestrial ( 1982 ) from the number-one box office spot and became the second highest-grossing horror film of 1982 , behind poltergeist .   the film has the third most attendance of any film in the friday the 13th series with approximately 11,762,400 tickets sold during its initial run .   jason 's look in this film , which varies greatly from its predecessor , has since become the look to which the character is modeled in later incarnations .
