rainbow bridge is a 1971 film directed by chuck wein about different countercultural figures interacting on the hawaiian island of maui .   he described it as " a kind of space-age candid camera .   we 're going to place pat [ new york model pat hartley , the protagonist ] in all kinds of real-life situtations , and film what happens .   we 're going to shoot a lot of film and just see what comes out of it . "   harry shapiro adds , " the idea was to shoot an antidote to easy rider , showing the positive side of the youth movement . "   filmed with non-professional actors and without a script , it features improvised scenes with a variety of characters .   when it became apparent that it was floundering , producer michael jeffery brought in his client jimi hendrix to film an outdoor concert ( july 30 , 1970 ) .   hendrix 's heavily edited ( no complete songs ) performance appears near the end of the film .   rainbow bridge was a critical failure and has been re-released on video tape and dvd formats .   although it only contains 17 minutes of hendrix performing , it continues to attract attention as his second-to-last american concert and the last one filmed .
