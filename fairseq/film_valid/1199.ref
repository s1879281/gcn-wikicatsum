reconstruction is a 2001 documentary made by irene lusztig that investigates the ioanid gang bank heist committed in 1959 in communist romania .   the film focuses on monica sevianu , lusztig 's grandmother , and the only female involved in the heist .   the documentary gets its name from a propaganda film that was made by the romanian government three years after the robbery was committed .   the original reconstruction was a strange blend of documentary and fiction , where the criminals played themselves in a crime-film whose plot was driven by clues that self-congratulatory detectives pieced together .   the propaganda film was only screened to journalists and high-ranking communist officials before being buried beneath government files .   lusztig managed to find a copy and incorporates clips into her documentary .
