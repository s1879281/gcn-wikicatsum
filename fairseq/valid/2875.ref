the &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; ( filmed in the early 1930s and the late 1940s ) is a home movie made by scott nixon , an avid member of the amateur cinema league and a traveling salesman based in augusta , georgia who enjoyed recording his travels on film . in this 16-minute silent film , nixon documents some 38 streets , &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; and cities named augusta in such &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; locales as montana and maine . arranged with no apparent rhyme or reason , the film strings together brief snapshots of these &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , many of which are indicated at the point of a pencil on a train &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; or road map . nixon photographed his odyssey using both 8 mm and 16 mm movie cameras loaded with black-and-white and color motion picture film stock , &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; feet of film that now resides at the university of south carolina . while nixon ’s film does not illuminate the historical or present-day significance of these towns , it &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; them together under the umbrella of americana . whether intentionally or coincidentally , this amateur auteur seems to &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; the name ’s &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; origin — ‘ august , ’ meaning great or venerable — with the &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; nature of everyday life in small-town america .
