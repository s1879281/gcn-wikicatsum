" graham &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; at the yorkshire film archive was amazing , " said kim longinotto . " i had a long conversation with him about the film and then a couple of weeks later he sent us an absolute feast of archive that was exactly what we needed . the clips he sent us were often very personal and affectionate and had been filmed by the families themselves . they were like early home movies but they were beautifully made . jan &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; found so many unexpected gems in the bfi archive for us too . one of my favorite moments is a little girl in a village school being crowned may queen . also piccadilly is an amazing film . it stars anna may wong who i ’d never even heard of . she is spectacular and the acting is mostly very understated and truthful . " " it was extraordinary to watch archive film coming to life with richard hawley ’s intimate and emotional songs and often see a new meaning emerge . richard ’s music creates a new kind of reality and suddenly the people looking out at you from the past seem so contemporary and vivid . " the film was commissioned by bbc north , bbc storyville and the bfi , and produced by crossover and lone star . it was edited by ollie huddleston . the premiere was at chatsworth house in &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; on wednesday 11 june 2014 as part of sheffield doc/fest .
