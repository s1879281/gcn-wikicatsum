the dove ( de &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; ) is a 1968 american short film that humorously parodies the films of swedish director ingmar bergman . the film borrows heavily from the plot lines of some of bergman 's most famous films made before 1968 . there is a journey by car back to the location of childhood memories as in wild strawberries . the main characters meet with the &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; figure of death as in the seventh seal . the film was directed by george coe and anthony lover . madeline kahn made her first film appearance , in a supporting role . the dialogue and voice-over narration are spoken mostly in a heavily &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; fictional language , which is mostly english made to sound like swedish , with many of the &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; ending in " &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; " . ( for example , the subtitled word " eventually " is spoken in dialogue as " &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; or &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; " . ) there are also a smattering of yiddish words . the subtitles , which often do not literally match the dialogue , add to the humor . the film was often shown in repertory film houses as a short feature when bergman films were on the bill . audiences frequently did not realize that the short was a comedy until individuals started laughing when they began to understand the fake swedish .
