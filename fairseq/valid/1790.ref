the shining is a 1980 psychological horror film produced and directed by stanley kubrick and co-written with novelist diane johnson . the film is based on stephen king 's 1977 novel the shining . the shining stars jack nicholson as jack torrance , an aspiring writer and recovering alcoholic who accepts a position as the &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; caretaker of the historic overlook hotel in the colorado rockies . his family accompanies him on this job , including his young son danny torrance ( danny lloyd ) , who possesses " the shining " , an array of psychic abilities that allow danny to see the hotel 's horrific past . after a winter storm leaves them snowbound , supernatural forces inhabiting the hotel influence jack 's sanity , leaving his wife ( shelley duvall ) and son in incredible danger . supporting roles are provided by scatman crothers , barry nelson , philip stone , joe &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; and tony burton . production took place almost exclusively at emi elstree studios with sets strongly based on existing locations . kubrick often worked with a small crew which allowed him to do many takes , sometimes to the exhaustion of the actors and staff . the new steadicam was used in several scenes giving it an innovative and immersive look and feel . because of inconsistencies , &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , symbolism , and differences from the book , there has been much speculation into the meanings and actions in the movie . unlike kubrick 's previous works , which developed audiences gradually through word-of-mouth , the shining was released as a &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; film , initially opening in two u.s. cities on memorial day , then nationwide within a month . the european release of the shining a few months later was 25 minutes shorter due to kubrick 's removal of most of the scenes taking place outside the environs of the hotel . although contemporary responses from critics were mixed , assessment became more favorable in following decades , and it is now widely regarded as one of the greatest horror films ever made . american director martin scorsese ranked it one of the 11 scariest horror movies of all time . critics , scholars , and crew members ( such as kubrick 's producer jan harlan ) have discussed the film 's enormous influence on popular culture .
