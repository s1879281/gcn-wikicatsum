neon color spreading ( also referred to as &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; color spreading ) is an optical illusion characterized by fluid borders between the edges of a colored object and the background in the presence of black lines . the illusion was first documented in 1971 and was eventually rediscovered in 1975 by van &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; . " neon " references a neon tube and the bright colors that appear within one . " color spreading " references how the colors seem to spread out from the center of the colored portion of the object . neon color spreading is similar to the watercolor illusion , though the two are not to be confused with one another as they are produced in different ways .
