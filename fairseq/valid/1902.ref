eclipse of reason is a 1987 pro-life documentary video directed , filmed , and narrated by bernard nathanson , with an introduction by charlton heston . eclipse of reason is a follow up to nathanson ’s first film the silent scream . the film is perhaps most known for its controversial depiction of a &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; and evacuation ( &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; ) abortion . the subject matter of this film focuses more on the moral implications of abortion . it served as nathanson ’s call to the women of the world to end the practice of abortion . this film , as well as the silent scream , was instrumental in the right to life committee 's garnering the attention of the united states public regarding the issue of abortion . eclipse of reason represented the argument that the fetus is human , and therefore abortion is murder , a belief in line with the pro-life movement . the film also serves to combat critics to the silent scream who argue that , although nathanson claimed the film relied only on imagery and not &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; speech , the film was heavily reliant on upon the language of the narrator . therefore , eclipse of reason delivers the same message that abortion is murder , with similar imagery as its predecessor the silent scream ; however , to avoid the previous appropriation of language over imagery eclipse of reason asks it viewers to consider reason rather than using emotionally charged narration .
