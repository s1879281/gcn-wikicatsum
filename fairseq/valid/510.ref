get carter is a 1971 british crime film directed by mike hodges and starring michael caine , ian hendry , britt ekland , john osborne and bryan mosley . the screenplay was adapted by hodges from ted lewis 's 1969 novel jack 's return home . producer michael klinger optioned the book and made a deal for the ailing metro-goldwyn-mayer ( mgm ) studio to finance and release the film , bringing in hodges and caine . caine became a co-producer of the film . get carter was hodges ' first feature film as director , as well as being the screen debut of alun armstrong . mgm was scaling back its european operations and the film became the last project approved before the american company closed its borehamwood studios . the film is set in north-east england and was filmed in and around newcastle upon tyne , &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; and county durham . the story follows a london gangster , the eponymous jack carter ( caine ) , who travels back to his hometown to discover more about the events surrounding his brother frank 's supposedly accidental death . suspecting foul play , he investigates and &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , regaining a feel for the city and its &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; element ; with vengeance on his mind , the situation builds to a violent conclusion . caine and hodges had ambitions to produce a more gritty and realistic portrayal of on-screen violence and criminal behaviour than had previously been seen in a british film . caine incorporated his knowledge of real criminal acquaintances into his characterisation of carter . hodges and cinematographer wolfgang &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; drew heavily on their backgrounds in documentary film . this — combined with hodges ' research into the contemporary criminal underworld of newcastle ( in particular the one-armed bandit murder ) , and the use of hundreds of local bystanders as extras — produced a naturalistic feel in many scenes . the shoot was &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; and progressed &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , despite a &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; strike by the association of cinematograph , television and allied technicians . the production went from novel to finished film in eight months , with location shooting lasting 40 days . get carter suffered in its promotion , firstly from mgm 's problems and secondly owing to the declining british film industry of the period , which relied increasingly on us investment . initial uk critical reaction to the film was mixed , with british reviewers &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; appreciative of the film 's technical excellence , but &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; by the complex plotting , the excessive violence and &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , in particular carter 's apparent lack of remorse at his actions . despite this the film did good business in the uk and produced a respectable profit . conversely , us critics were generally more enthusiastic and praised the film , but it was poorly promoted in the states by united artists and languished on the drive in circuit while mgm focused its resources on producing a blaxploitation version of the same novel , hit man . on its release get carter received no awards and did not seem likely to be well remembered . it was n't available on home media until 1993 , however it always maintained a cult following . subsequently , &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; from a new generation of directors such as quentin tarantino and guy ritchie led to a critical reappraisal which saw it recognized as one of the best british movies of all time . in 1999 , get carter was ranked 16th on the bfi top 100 british films of the 20th century ; five years later , a survey of british film critics in total film magazine chose it as the greatest british film of all time . get carter was remade in 2000 by warner bros. under the same title , with sylvester stallone starring as jack carter , while caine appears in a supporting role . this remake was not well received by critics in the usa and was not given a uk theatrical release .
