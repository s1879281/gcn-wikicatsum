&lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; ( english : against nature ) , also known in english as the green inferno and cannibal holocaust ii , is a 1988 italian adventure film directed by mondo director antonio climati . climati had no intention of making a sequel to cannibal holocaust , and the title was used by distributors of the film to cash in on the success and notoriety of the earlier film . until recently , the film was relatively obscure . it is best known among cult fans as the film that ended the cannibal genre , which , by then , had virtually fallen extinct . in 2002 , british distributor &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; released &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; on vhs and dvd as cannibal holocaust ii , the film 's most common release . this was the last film directed by climati , who had gained notoriety as a major player in the mondo documentary film genre . although fictional , this film deals with many common tropes of mondo films , including exotic customs and locales , and cruel violence . strangely , however , the film appears to show compassion towards animals , while a main staple of mondo films is often real violence towards animals .
