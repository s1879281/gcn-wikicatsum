the thief is a 1952 american film noir crime film directed by russell rouse and starring ray milland . it 's the third in a series of six classic film noir productions scripted by rouse and his writing partner clarence greene . the film is unusual because there is no principal actor dialogue spoken . the principal characters are not " &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; " , as they might be in a more conventional film , as this film is more about " &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; " , not as much about the principal characters and their respective personalities . not &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; that observation , the film certainly depends upon the exceptionally strong dramatic performance by ray milland , and the equally strong music performance by &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; herschel burke gilbert . the film is nearly fully orchestrated by gilbert .
