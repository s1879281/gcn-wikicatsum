rachel is a 2009 documentary film by simone &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; detailing the death of rachel corrie . rachel was an american peace activist , killed by an israeli military &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; in 2003 during a nonviolent action against the demolition of &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; homes in &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , gaza . the premiere was at berlin film festival in february 2009 . " rachel is an in-depth cinematic investigation into the death of an unknown young girl , made with a rigor and scope normally reserved for first-rate historical characters . it gives voice to all the people involved in rachel ’s story , from palestinian and foreign witnesses to israeli military &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; and investigators , doctors , activists and soldiers linked to the affair . the film begins like a classic documentary , but soon develops , &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; its subject and transforming into a cinematographic meditation on youth , war , idealism and political utopia . in the beginning , there is this : she was called rachel corrie . she was 23 . she was convinced that her american nationality would be enough to make her an effective human shield , that her simple presence would save lives , olive trees , wells and houses . " simone &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; : " i suppose that i initiated the project of rachel as an attempt to cleanse myself of this shame : i wanted to film in gaza because i know that if filmmakers stop filming in places where they are not welcome , not only will it become easier for occupation forces everywhere to kill and destroy – but also documentary cinema itself will die – and only the tv news media spectacle of war will remain . " the first north american public screening was at the 2009 tribeca film festival . it is said the film reports the case from " an israeli point of view " . but a controversy arose with respect to the showing of the film at the 2009 san francisco jewish film festival , and the festival 's extending an invitation to corrie 's mother to speak . jewish voice for peace , the film 's sponsor , was called " anti-semitic " by the festival managers .
