&lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; is a 1986 film directed by daryl duke , loosely based on james clavell 's 1966 eponymous novel . while many of the same characters and plot twists are maintained , a few smaller occurrences are left out . filmed under communist chinese censorship , some portions of clavell 's story were considered too offensive to be filmed as written and considerable changes were made . the de laurentiis entertainment group handled the production and were actively seen battling the chinese government and labor boards over the film during shooting . the results fared poorly at the box office and in critical reviews . duke believed that a mini-series Ã  la &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; or noble house would have been a far superior means of covering the complexity of clavell 's novel .
