white dog is a 1982 american drama film , which samuel fuller directed from a screenplay he and curtis hanson had dramatized , which , in turn , they based loosely on romain gary 's 1970 novel of the same title . the film depicts the struggle of a dog trainer named keys ( paul winfield ) , who is black , trying to &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; a stray dog found by a young actress ( kristy mcnichol ) , that is a " white dog " -- a dog trained to make vicious attacks upon , and to murder , any black person . fuller uses the film as a platform to deliver an &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; message as it examines the question of whether racism is a &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; problem or an &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; condition . the film 's theatrical release was suppressed after a week in the united states by paramount pictures out of concern of negative press after rumors began circulating that the film was racist . prior to the date , it was released internationally in france in july 1982 . its first official american home video release came in december 2008 when the criterion collection released the original uncut film to dvd . critics praised the film 's &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; look at racism and fuller 's use of melodrama and &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; to present his argument , and its somewhat &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; ending that leaves the impression that while racism is learned , it can not be cured . reviewers consistently questioned the film 's lack of wide release in the united states when it was completed and applauded its belated release by criterion .
