biblical accommodation is the adaptation of words or sentences from the bible to signify ideas different from those expressed therein . thus , if a sinner excuses his fault by saying , " the serpent deceived me " , he applies the &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; words of eve ( gen. , iii , 13 ) to express an idea which the sentence does not convey in the bible . similarly , a blind person might use the words of &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , v , 12 , " what manner of joy shall be to me , who sit in darkness , and see not the light of heaven " . here , again , the words would have a meaning which they do not bear in sacred scripture . this accommodation is sometimes incorrectly styled the &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , or &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , sense of scripture . from the definition it is clear that it is not a sense of scripture at all . the possibility of such accommodation may arise , first , from some similarity between the ideas in the sacred text and the subject to which the passage is &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; ; secondly , from the fact that the words of scripture may be understood in two different senses . the first is called extensive accommodation . examples of it are found in the church 's offices , both in the &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; and the &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , when the praises bestowed by the holy ghost on noe , isaac , and moses are applied to other saints . thus the words of &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , 1 , 5 : " have they made thee ruler ? . . . hinder not music " are sometimes applied to college presidents assuming the burden of their office ; we need not say that the words of sacred scripture have quite a different meaning . the second species of accommodation , called &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , is often a mere play on words and at times seems due to a misunderstanding of the original meaning . the &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; text , &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; deus in &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; suis ( &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , 36 ) means , in the mouth of the &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , that god is wonderful in his sanctuary ( &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , - &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; ) . the latin words may also be translated " god is wonderful in his saints " ( &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , - &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; ) , and they are employed in this sense in the &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; . as this second &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; was not intended by the inspired writer , the english rendering of the text in the &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; version is a &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; .
