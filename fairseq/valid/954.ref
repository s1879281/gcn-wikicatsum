kodak high-speed infrared film , also known as kodak &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , was a popular black-and-white infrared photographic film from kodak . the prominent &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; or " glow " often seen in the highlights of infrared photographs is an artifact of &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; and not of infrared light itself ( nor even of all &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; films ) . this is because although conventional photographic films have an &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; layer that &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; scattered light , &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; lacks this backing . kodak &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; must only be loaded and &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; in total darkness . &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; features a polyester film base that is very stable but &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; to &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , and therefore requires extra care during development , processing and &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; .
