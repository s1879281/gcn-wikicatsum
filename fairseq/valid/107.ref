friday the 13th part vi : jason lives ( also known on screen as jason lives : friday the 13th part vi ) is a 1986 american slasher film and the sixth installment in the friday the 13th film series . it was written and directed by tom mcloughlin . although the original concept called for tommy jarvis , the protagonist of friday the 13th : the final chapter and friday the 13th : a new beginning , to become the new villain , the poor fan reception of a new beginning prompted the producers to bring back jason voorhees as the series ' antagonist . in resurrecting jason , mcloughlin made jason an explicitly supernatural force for the first time in the series , depicting him as being raised from the dead via electricity ; this version of jason , an undead mass murderer and more powerful superhuman , would become the standard depiction for the rest of the films , until 2009 's remake . the film likewise broke with many other series conventions , introducing &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; and action film elements including &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; and car chases . the film was the first film in the series to receive favorable reviews since the original . in the years since its release , its self-referential humor and numerous instances of breaking the fourth wall have been praised for &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; wes craven 's scream series and other similar 1990s horror films . as of 2003 's freddy vs. jason , jason lives was a fan favorite of the series , in addition to receiving positive notice from horror film historians . it is followed by friday the 13th part vii : the new blood .
