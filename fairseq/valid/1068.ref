psycho is a 1998 american horror film produced and directed by gus van sant for universal pictures , a remake of the 1960 film directed by alfred hitchcock and starring vince vaughn , julianne moore , viggo mortensen , william h. macy and anne heche . the film is about an embezzler who arrives at an old motel run by an insane killer named norman bates . both films are adapted from robert bloch 's 1959 novel of the same name , which was in turn inspired by the crimes of wisconsin murderer ed gein . although this version is in color , features a different cast , and is set in 1998 , it is closer to a shot-for-shot remake than most remakes , often copying hitchcock 's camera movements and editing , and joseph stefano 's script is mostly carried over . bernard herrmann 's musical score is reused as well , though with a new arrangement by danny elfman and recorded in stereo . some changes are introduced to account for advances in technology since the original film and to make the content more explicit . murder sequences are also intercut with surreal dream images . the film received negative reviews and was both a commercial and critical failure . it was nominated for three golden raspberry awards and won two , the film for worst prequel , remake , rip-off , or sequel , van sant for worst director , and heche was nominated for worst actress .
