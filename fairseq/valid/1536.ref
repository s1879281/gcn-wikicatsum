the &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; illusion or &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; circles is an optical illusion of relative size perception . named for its &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; , the german psychologist hermann &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; ( 1850 â€“ 1909 ) , the illusion was popularized in the english-speaking world by edward b. &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; in a 1901 textbook of experimental psychology , hence its alternative ' " &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; circles " . in the best-known version of the illusion , two circles of identical size are placed near to each other , and one is surrounded by large circles while the other is surrounded by small circles . as a result of the juxtaposition of circles , the central circle surrounded by large circles appears smaller than the central circle surrounded by small circles . recent work suggests that two other critical factors involved in the perception of the &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; illusion are the distance of the surrounding circles from the central circle and the &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; of the annulus , which makes the illusion comparable in nature to the &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; illusion . regardless of relative size , if the surrounding circles are closer to the central circle , the central circle appears larger and if the surrounding circles are far away , the central circle appears smaller . while the distance variable appears to be an active factor in the perception of relative size , the size of the surrounding circles limits how close they can be to the central circle , resulting in many studies &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; the two &lt;&lt;unk&gt;&gt; .
