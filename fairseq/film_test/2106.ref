alice 's adventures in wonderland is a 10-minute black-and-white silent film made in the united states in 1910 . made by the edison manufacturing company and directed by edwin s. porter , the film starred gladys hulette as alice . being a silent film , naturally all of lewis carroll 's nonsensical prose could not be used , and , being only a one-reel picture , most of carroll 's memorable characters in his original 1865 novel similarly could not be included . what was used in the film was faithful in spirit to carroll , and in design to the original john tenniel illustrations . variety complimented the picture by comparing it favourably to the " foreign " film fantasies then flooding american cinemas .
