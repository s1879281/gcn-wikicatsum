scarfies ( or crime 101 in the us release ) is a low-budget 1999 new zealand film set in the southern university city of dunedin . the film 's original title comes from the local nickname for university students , scarfie , so called because of the traditional blue and gold scarves worn by students during the city 's cool winters in support of the otago rugby football union . scarfies starts off as a light comedy centred on a group of five students who get together after moving into a flat that is seemingly abandoned , but still has the power on , making for free if filthy accommodation . the film twists into something darker part way through , with elements of both black comedy and thriller . the discovery of a large crop of marijuana being grown in the basement leads firstly to euphoria , then paranoia and arguments amongst the flatmates about what will happen when the real owners come back to collect it . when kevin , the crop 's owner appears , the students , fearing for their lives , lock him in the basement . events unfold against a backdrop of the city 's biggest sporting event for years , the final of new zealand 's national rugby championship . despite the deliberate use of shots focusing on the city 's dowdier and darker elements , much of the film 's photography and soundtrack is an homage to the city , including the use of several dunedin sound songs in the soundtrack ( top local band the clean even make a cameo appearance during the film ) . the film was well-received , described as " ... the most outlandishly entertaining new zealand film for years ... " , and did well at the box-office .
