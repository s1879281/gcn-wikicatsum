like the clouds , like the wind ( japanese : 雲のように 風のように hepburn : kumo no yō ni kaze no yō ni ) is an anime television film in japan produced by studio pierrot for ntv and based on the novel by ken ' ichi sakemi . it is often incorrectly thought to be produced by studio ghibli due to the character designs by katsuya kondō ( who has worked on many ghibli films ) , partially due to an error in its first fan translation that attributed the screenplay to hayao miyazaki instead of akira miyazaki , and the higher quality of the animation for a tv movie . however , studio ghibli had no involvement in the film .
