tansy is a 1921 british silent drama film directed by cecil hepworth and starring alma taylor , gerald ames and james carew . the film was based on a popular rural novel of the time by tickner edwardes , and was filmed largely on location on the sussex downs . tansy is a rare survival among hepworth 's feature-length films of the late 1910s and early 1920s , most of which are believed to have been irretrievably lost following hepworth 's bankruptcy in 1924 , when his film stock was seized and melted down by administrators to release its saleable silver nitrate content . a full print of the film is held in the british film institute 's national archive . hepworth once remarked : " it was always in the back of my mind from the very beginning that i was to make english pictures with all the english countryside for background and with english idiom throughout . " critical assessment of tansy tends to confirm the ability to capture beautiful english rural landscapes on film as hepworth 's greatest skill , albeit sometimes to the detriment of dramatic narrative when the scenery seems to command more of his attention than the actors or the plot .
