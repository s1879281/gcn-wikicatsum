a cyclic redundancy check ( crc ) is an error-detecting code commonly used in digital networks and storage devices to detect accidental changes to raw data . blocks of data entering these systems get a short check value attached , based on the remainder of a polynomial division of their contents . on retrieval , the calculation is repeated and , in the event the check values do not match , corrective action can be taken against data corruption . crcs can be used for error correction , see bitfilters . crcs are so called because the check ( data verification ) value is a redundancy ( it expands the message without adding information ) and the algorithm is based on cyclic codes . crcs are popular because they are simple to implement in binary hardware , easy to analyze mathematically , and particularly good at detecting common errors caused by noise in transmission channels . because the check value has a fixed length , the function that generates it is occasionally used as a hash function . the crc was invented by w. wesley peterson in 1961 ; the 32-bit crc function of ethernet and many other standards is the work of several researchers and was published in 1975 .
