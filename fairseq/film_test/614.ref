a medical animation is a short educational film , usually based around a physiological or surgical topic , that is rendered using 3d computer graphics . while it may be intended for an array of audiences , the medical animation is most commonly utilized as an instructional tool for medical professionals or their patients . early medical animations were limited to basic wire-frame models because of low processor speed . however , rapid evolution in microprocessor design and computer memory has led to animations that are significantly more intricate . the medical animation may be viewed as a standalone visualization , or in combination with other sensory input devices , such as head-mounted displays , stereoscopic lenses , haptic gloves , interactive workstations , or cave automatic virtual environments ( caves ) .
