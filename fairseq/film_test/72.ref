wall of hits is the first compilation of music videos from english rock band slade . the compilation was titled after the audio/cd compilation of the same year . it was released by polygram video . the compilation only exists on vhs and is now out of print , never being released onto dvd . all videos from this compilation do exist on the 2005 dvd compilation the very best of slade though . the set features many of slade 's hits however misses tracks such as cum on feel the noize , look wot you dun , take me bak ' ome , skweeze me , pleeze me and get down and get with it . also , much of the bands 1980s material is missing , most likely due to the band being on the rca records label for the decade and not polydor . two new singles were released to promote the wall of hits cd and vhs . the hit single radio wall of sound has the music video included on the compilation whereas the other single universe does n't , due to video not yet being filmed .
