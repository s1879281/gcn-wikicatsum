( the film does not feature ted healy or the other stooges and is the only known solo screen appearance of curly howard without his brother moe . ) the music is by dmitri tiomkin , who was married to rasch at the time . notable in this film is howard being more of a " middle stooge , " similar to larry fine 's character in the three stooges films , and using his real voice without the " curly " inflections . calahan played the " dumb " character that howard would normally play . the short , filmed in two-strip technicolor , uses the " chinese ballet " segment from the mgm movie children of pleasure and the " woman in the shoe " segment from mgm 's lord byron of broadway ( both 1930 ) .
