the peacemaker ( 1956 ) is a western film directed by ted post and starring james mitchell , rosemarie bowe , and jan merlin . hal richards based the script on the novel of the same name by richard poole . producer hal r. makelim intended the peacemaker to be the first of a series of low-budget productions . according to merlin , who played the villain , shooting took only " seven or ten days . " although the film featured some successful character actors like hugh sanders in supporting roles , none of the performers qualified as marquee names ; in fact , at this point in his career , star james mitchell was known only as a dancer ( despite some dramatic roles at mgm ) . while makelim tried to compensate for these problems by marketing the film to a religious audience â€” the local clergymen were invited to the film 's premiere in wichita -- the peacemaker enjoyed only sporadic distribution and was not widely reviewed . makelim managed to produce only one more film , valerie ( 1957 ) , and mitchell would not make another film appearance until the turning point ( 1977 ) .
