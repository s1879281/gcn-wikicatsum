in computer terminology , polymorphic code is code that uses a polymorphic engine to mutate while keeping the original algorithm intact . that is , the code changes itself each time it runs , but the function of the code ( its semantics ) will not change at all . for example , 1 +3 and 6-2 both achieve the same result while using different values and operations . this technique is sometimes used by computer viruses , shellcodes and computer worms to hide their presence . encryption is the most common method to hide code . with encryption , the main body of the code ( also called its payload ) is encrypted and will appear meaningless . for the code to function as before , a decryption function is added to the code . when the code is executed this function reads the payload and decrypts it before executing it in turn . encryption alone is not polymorphism . to gain polymorphic behavior , the encryptor/decryptor pair are mutated with each copy of the code . this allows different versions of some code which all function the same .
