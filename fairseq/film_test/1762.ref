cabiria is a 1914 italian epic silent film , directed by giovanni pastrone and shot in turin . the film is set in ancient sicily , carthage , and cirta during the period of the second punic war ( 218 – 202 bc ) . it follows a melodramatic main plot about an abducted little girl , cabiria , and features an eruption of mt. etna , heinous religious rituals in carthage , the alpine trek of hannibal , archimedes ' defeat of the roman fleet at the siege of syracuse and scipio maneuvering in north africa . apart from being a classic on its own terms , the film is also notable for being the first film in which the long-running film character maciste makes his debut . according to martin scorsese , in this work pastrone invented the epic movie and deserves credit for many of the innovations often attributed to d.w. griffith and cecil b. demille . among those was the extensive use of a moving camera , thus freeing the feature-length narrative film from " static gaze " . the historical background and characters in the story are taken from livy 's ab urbe condita ( written ca. 27 – 25 bc ) . in addition , the script of cabiria was partially based on gustave flaubert 's 1862 novel salammbo and emilio salgari 's 1908 novel cartagine in fiamme ( carthage in flames ) .
