amarcord is a 1973 italian comedy-drama film directed by federico fellini , a semi-autobiographical tale about titta , an adolescent boy growing up among an eccentric cast of characters in the village of borgo san giuliano ( situated near the ancient walls of rimini ) in 1930s fascist italy . the film 's title ( [ amarˈkɔrd ] ) is a univerbation of the romagnolo phrase " a m ' arcord " ( " i remember " ) . the title then became a neologism of the italian language , with the meaning of ' nostalgic revocation ' . titta 's sentimental education is emblematic of italy 's " lapse of conscience . " fellini skewers mussolini 's ludicrous posturings and those of a catholic church that " imprisoned italians in a perpetual adolescence " by mocking himself and his fellow villagers in comic scenes that underline their incapacity to adopt genuine moral responsibility or outgrow foolish sexual fantasies . the film won the oscar for best foreign language film , and was nominated for two academy awards : best director and best writing , original screenplay .
