it 's all about love is a 2003 romance-drama film written and directed by thomas vinterberg . its narrative can be classified as apocalyptic science fiction , but vinterberg prefers to call it " a dream " . unlike the director 's earlier danish-language films , it 's all about love is entirely in english and stars joaquin phoenix , claire danes and sean penn . the production was led by denmark 's nimbus film , but the film was largely an international co-production , with involvement of companies from nine different countries in total . it was very poorly received by film critics .
