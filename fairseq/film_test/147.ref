antarctica : a year on ice is the first feature film by new zealand filmmaker anthony b. powell . this documentary is set in antarctica , specifically in the ross island region , which is home to two research bases : united states ' mcmurdo station and new zealand 's scott base . it chronicles a year of time spent living and working at these remote stations ; the summer season ( october to february ) when the sun shines 24 hours a day and the long dark winter ( february to october ) where the sun goes down for four long months and darkness envelopes the environment . the film focuses on the everyday workers that keep the stations and the equipment running so the scientists can complete their work . interviewees include a helicopter pilot , fireman , firehouse dispatcher , cook , mechanic , storekeeper , storeman , finance person , administrative person , and operations manager . extensive use of time-lapse photography is used to document the changing seasons and the antarctic landscapes . powell had to invent many of his own camera systems to survive the extreme conditions of the deep antarctic winter . powell 's previous work includes footage for discovery , national geographic , and was featured in bbc 's frozen planet . the film also touches upon topics such as ' t3 syndrome , ' a term that describes what happens to people during the winter , when the t3 hormone in the brain is reassigned to the muscles of the body in an effort to protect it against the extreme cold . the film also describes how the community works and plays together including the annual new year 's party " ice stock " . the film 's post-production was completed at park road post production in wellington , new zealand .
