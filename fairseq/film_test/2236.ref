licence to kill ( 1989 ) is the sixteenth spy film in the james bond film series by eon productions , and the first one not to use the title of an ian fleming story . it is the fifth and final consecutive bond film to be directed by john glen . it also marks timothy dalton 's second and final performance in the role of james bond . the story has elements of two ian fleming short stories and a novel , interwoven with aspects from japanese r≈çnin tales . the film sees bond being suspended from mi6 as he pursues drugs lord franz sanchez , who has ordered an attack against his cia friend felix leiter and a rape and murder on felix 's wife during their honeymoon . originally titled licence revoked in line with the plot , the name was changed during post-production because too many people did not know what revoked meant . budgetary reasons caused licence to kill to be the first bond film shot completely outside the united kingdom , with locations in both florida and mexico . the film earned over $ 156 million worldwide , and enjoyed a generally positive critical reception , with ample praise for the stunts , but attracted some criticism of dalton 's dark and violent interpretation of bond and the fact that the film was significantly darker and more violent than its predecessors . after the release of licence to kill , legal wrangling over control of the series and the james bond character resulted in a six-year-long delay in production of the next bond film which resulted in dalton deciding not to return . it is also the final bond film for actors robert brown ( as m ) and caroline bliss ( as moneypenny ) , screenwriter richard maibaum , title designer maurice binder , editor john grover , cinematographer alec mills , director and former bond film editor john glen , and producer albert r. broccoli , although he would later act as a consulting producer for goldeneye before his death .
