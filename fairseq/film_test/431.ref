trafic ( traffic ) is a 1971 italian-french comedy film directed by jacques tati . trafic was the last film to feature tati 's famous character of monsieur hulot , and followed the vein of earlier tati films that lampooned modern society . tati 's use of the word " trafic " instead of the usual french word for car traffic ( la circulation ) may derive from a desire to use the same franglais he used when he called his previous film play time , and the primary meaning of trafic is " exchange of goods " , rather than " traffic " per se . the word " trafic " was subsequently used for a light utility vehicle model manufactured by renault starting in 1981 .
