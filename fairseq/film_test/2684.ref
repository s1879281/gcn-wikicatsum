agaram ( english : the first letter of the tamil alphabet ) is a 2007 indian tamil action film written and directed by t. nagarajan , who had earlier directed the 1997 film aravindhan starring sarath kumar . it stars nandha of mounam pesiyadhe and punnagai poove fame and newcomer archana in the lead roles , with biju menon portraying the role of the antagonist , and vivek , seetha and raj kapoor among others in supporting roles . despite being announced shortly after nandha 's debut in 2002 , the film 's release was delayed and eventually released on 16 february 2007 , failing at the box office as it was released at the same time as ameer 's award-winning film paruthiveeran . the film is probably well known for a controversy concerning kireedam , a high budget film , whose makers demanded to see agaram before its release , fearing that the story was plagiarised from its script .
