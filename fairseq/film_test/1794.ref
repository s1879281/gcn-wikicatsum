st trinian 's is a 2007 british comedy film and the sixth in a long-running series of british films based on the works of cartoonist ronald searle set in st trinian 's school . the first five films form a series , starting with the belles of st trinian 's in 1954 , with sequels in 1957 , 1960 , 1966 , and 1980 . the 2007 release , coming twenty seven years after the last entry , and fifty three years after the first film , is a rebooting of the franchise , rather than a direct sequel , with certain plot elements borrowed from the first film . whereas the earlier films concentrated on the adults , this film gives the school pupils greater prominence . st trinian 's is an anarchic school for uncontrollable girls run by eccentric headmistress camilla dagey fritton ( the reboot continues the tradition , established by alastair sim in the original film , of casting a male actor to play the female headmistress , with rupert everett inheriting the role ) . st trinian 's received mixed reviews .
