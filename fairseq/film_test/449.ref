your name is justine ( polish : masz na imię justine ) is a 2005 luxembourgish film directed by franco de peña . de peña had originally wanted to produce the film in germany , but when he was unable to garner enough funds , he came to luxembourg . the film was co-produced by luxembourg hemisphere films and polish opus film , and shot primarily in luxembourg with the aid of numerous local technicians . as a result of the multifaceted production , the dialogue of the movie is in english , german and polish . the plot of the story revolves around a girl called mariola ( anna cieslak ) , who is forced into prostitution in berlin , and attempts to hold on to her sense of self despite being exploited by those around her . the film was luxembourg 's submission to the 79th academy awards for the academy award for best foreign language film . although previous submissions ( such as italy 's private ) had been rejected due to not being in the official language of the country , the academy removed the requirement for the 79th academy awards , allowing your name is justine and other films such as canada 's water ( which contained only hindi dialogue ) to be submitted . however , the film was rejected by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences before the formal review process . the academy determined that there was not enough creative contribution from luxembourg to qualify under the academy 's requirements , which stress that a " submitting country must certify that creative talent of that country exercised artistic control of the film . " joy hoffman , the head of luxembourg 's foreign-language oscar committee , was disappointed by the rejection . although he accepted the notion that the film was a " borderline entry " , he noted that " without luxembourg the film would n't exist " .
