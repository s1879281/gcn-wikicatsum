in economics and finance , a taleb distribution is the statistical profile of an investment which normally provides a payoff of small positive returns , while carrying a small but significant risk of catastrophic losses . the term was coined by journalist martin wolf and economist john kay to describe investments with a " high probability of a modest gain and a low probability of huge losses in any period . " the concept is named after nassim nicholas taleb , based on ideas outlined in his fooled by randomness . according to taleb in silent risk , the term should be called " payoff " to reflect the importance of the payoff function of the underlying probability distribution , rather than the distribution itself . the term is meant to refer to an investment returns profile in which there is a high probability of a small gain , and a small probability of a very large loss , which more than outweighs the gains . in these situations the expected value is very much less than zero , but this fact is camouflaged by the appearance of low risk and steady returns . it is a combination of kurtosis risk and skewness risk : overall returns are dominated by extreme events ( kurtosis ) , which are to the downside ( skew ) . more detailed and formal discussion of the bets on small probability events is in the academic essay by taleb , called " why did the crisis of 2008 happen ? " and in the 2004 paper in the journal of behavioral finance called " why do we prefer asymmetric payoffs ? " in which he writes " agents risking other people â€™s capital would have the incentive to camouflage the properties by showing a steady income . intuitively , hedge funds are paid on an annual basis while disasters happen every four or five years , for example . the fund manager does not repay his incentive fee .
