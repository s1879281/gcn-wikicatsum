the unknown is a 1927 american silent horror film directed by tod browning and featuring lon chaney as carnival knife thrower alonzo the armless and joan crawford as the scantily clad carnival girl he hopes to marry . film historian ken hanke considers the film to be in many respects the best of browning 's films with lon chaney . burt lancaster said that chaney 's portrayal in the unknown featured “ one of the most compelling and emotionally exhausting scenes i have ever seen an actor do . ” chaney did remarkable and convincing collaborative scenes with real-life armless double paul desmuke ( sometimes credited as peter dismuki ) , whose legs and feet were used to manipulate objects such as knives and cigarettes in frame with chaney 's upper body and face . as with browning 's later sound film freaks ( 1932 ) , contemporary reviewers were sometimes less appreciative . " a visit to the dissecting room in a hospital would be quite as pleasant , " opined the new york evening post , " and at the same time more instructive . " modern viewers can discern the same macabre style of this film ( and other browning-chaney collaborations ) in later productions ranging from the 1930s universal studios horror films to the 1960s twilight zone and alfred hitchcock presents programs .
