the current procedural terminology ( cpt ) code set is a medical code set maintained by the american medical association through the cpt editorial panel . the cpt code set ( copyright protected by the ama ) describes medical , surgical , and diagnostic services and is designed to communicate uniform information about medical services and procedures among physicians , coders , patients , accreditation organizations , and payers for administrative , financial , and analytical purposes . new editions are released each october . the current version is the cpt 2017 . it is available in both a standard edition and a professional edition . cpt coding is similar to icd-9 and icd-10 coding , except that it identifies the services rendered , rather than the diagnosis on the claim ( icd-10-cm was created for diagnostic coding - it took the place of volume 3 of the icd-9 ) . the icd code sets also contain procedure codes ( icd-10-pcs codes ) , but these are only used in the inpatient setting . cpt is currently identified by the centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) as level 1 of the healthcare common procedure coding system . the current procedural terminology ( cpt ) was developed by the american medical association ( ama ) .
