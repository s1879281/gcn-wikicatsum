army of shadows ( french : l'armée des ombres ) is a 1969 french film directed by jean-pierre melville . it is a film adaptation of joseph kessel 's 1943 book of the same name , which blends kessel 's own experiences as a member of the french resistance with fictionalized versions of other resistance members . army of shadows follows a small group of resistance fighters as they move between safe houses , work with the allied militaries , kill informers , and attempt to evade the capture and execution that they know is their most likely fate . while portraying its characters as heroic , the film presents a bleak , unromantic view of the resistance . at the time of its initial release in france , army of shadows was not well received or widely seen . in the wake of the events of may 1968 , french critics denounced the film for its perceived glorification of charles de gaulle . at the time american art-film programmers took their cues from cahiers du cinéma , which had attacked the film on this basis . it was not released in the united states for almost forty years . in the mid-1990s cahiers du cinéma published a reappraisal of the film and melville 's work in general , leading to its restoration and re-release in 2006 . the film was greeted with critical adulation in the u.s. , appearing in many critics ' year-end top ten lists .
