marcello francesco mastrilli ( 1603 â€“ october 17 , 1637 ) was an italian jesuit missionary who was martyred in japan on mount unzen during the tokugawa shogunate , which had banned christianity in 1614 . after sailing for japan out to find and possibly reconvert the notorious apostate christavao ferreira , who went to japan and renounced his faith there , he was arrested as soon as he got off his ship . after three days of torture in the pit of nagasaki , he was beheaded . a painting of his death , martyrdom of saint marcello mastrilli ( 1664 ) , was made by antonio maria vassallo . susceptible to visions , he was particularly influenced by visitations by the jesuit missionary st. francis xavier , who appeared to him twice in 1633 , and foretold him his martyrdom . st. frances xavier is credited with twice miraculously restoring mastrilli 's health ( even if only to incite him to do missionary work in japan ) , and since the account reportedly spread quickly through italy , the " novena of grace , " in honor of st. francis xavier , was established . mastrilli 's initiative is supposedly to thank for the presence of a silver casket in the basilica of bom jesus in old goa , which houses relics of the body of st. francis xavier .
