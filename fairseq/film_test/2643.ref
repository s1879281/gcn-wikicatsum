baise-moi ( fuck me ) is a 2000 french crime thriller film with elements of a rape and revenge film written and directed by virginie despentes and coralie trinh thi and starring karen lancaume and raffaÃ«la anderson . it is based on the novel by despentes , first published in 1993 . the film received intense media coverage because of its graphic mix of violence and explicit sex scenes . consequently , it is sometimes considered an example of the " new french extremity . " as a french noun , un baiser means " a kiss , " but as a verb , baiser means " to fuck , " so baise-moi means simply " fuck me . " in some markets the film has been screened as " rape me , " but the french for " rape me " is emphatically not " baise-moi , " but rather " viole-moi , " and so in a 2002 interview rape me was rejected by the directors . in 2000 , the film censorship board of malaysia banned the film outright because of " very high-impact violence and sexual content throughout . " later that same year , the film was banned in singapore owing to " depictions of sexual violence [ that ] may cause controversy . " in australia , the film was allowed to be shown at cinemas with an r18 + ( adults only ) rating . then in 2002 , the film was pulled from cinemas and television and after that , banned outright . the film is still banned there because of its " harmful , explicit sexually violent content , " and was re-banned in 2013 . however , an edited r18 + version was screened on 23 august 2013 on the world movies channel of the australian state broadcaster sbs , as part of the world movies " films that shocked the world " season .
