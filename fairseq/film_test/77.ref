god loves uganda is a documentary film produced and directed by roger ross williams , which premiered at the 2013 sundance film festival . it explores connections between evangelicalism in north america and in uganda , suggesting that the north american influence is the reason behind the controversial uganda anti-homosexuality act , which at one point raised the possibility of the death penalty for gays and lesbians . the filmmakers follow a group of young missionaries from the international house of prayer in their first missionary effort in another nation , as well as interviewing several evangelical leaders from the us and uganda . williams was inspired to make god loves uganda when he met david kato , an lbgt activist who was killed in 2011 , ostensibly in a robbery . kato told there was an untold story of the damage american fundamentalist evangelicals are doing in uganda ; of the insidious nature of their aggressive effort to harvest young , unclaimed souls to preach a gospel of love intertwined with a gospel of intolerance .
