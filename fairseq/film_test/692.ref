the rolling stones rock and roll circus is a film released in 1996 of an 11 december 1968 event organized by the rolling stones . the event comprised two concerts on a circus stage and included such acts as the who , taj mahal , marianne faithfull , and jethro tull . john lennon and his fiancee yoko ono performed as part of a supergroup called the dirty mac , along with eric clapton , mitch mitchell , and keith richards . the original line up was going to be the small faces , the rolling stones and the who and the concept of a circus was first thought up between mick jagger , pete townshend and ronnie lane and was originally meant to be aired on the bbc , but the rolling stones withheld it . the stones contended they did so due to their substandard performance , because they had taken the stage early in the morning and were clearly exhausted . many others believe that the true reason for not releasing the video was that the who , who were fresh off a concert tour , upstaged the stones on their own production . led zeppelin were also originally considered but the idea was also dropped .
