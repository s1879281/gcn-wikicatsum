village of the giants is a 1965 science-fiction/comedy movie with many elements of the beach party film genre . it was produced , directed and written by bert i. gordon , and based loosely on h.g. wells 's book the food of the gods . the story revolves mostly around a chemical substance called " goo " , which causes giant growth in living things , and what happens after a gang of rebellious youngsters get their hands on it . the cast was mostly teens , or young actors playing teens ; the beau brummels , freddy cannon , and mike clifford make musical guest appearances . the movie was a low-budget exploitation film and not a huge hit ( released mostly to drive-ins as part of a double bill ) , but had some notable use of special effects and undoubted sex appeal , and went on to become a cult classic . the movie proved far more successful years later , when released on home video .
