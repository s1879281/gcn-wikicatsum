women on the verge of a nervous breakdown ( spanish : mujeres al borde de un ataque de nervios ) is a 1988 spanish black comedy-drama film written and directed by pedro almodóvar , starring carmen maura and antonio banderas . the film brought almodóvar to widespread international attention : it was nominated for the 1988 academy award for best foreign language film , and won five goya awards including best film and best actress in a leading role for maura . the actual spanish title refers to an ataque de nervios , which is not actually well translated as " nervous breakdown " ( crisis nerviosa ) . ataques de nervios are culture-bound psychological phenomena during which the individual , most often female , displays dramatic outpouring of negative emotions , bodily gestures , occasional falling to the ground , and fainting , often in response to receiving disturbing news or witnessing or participating in an upsetting event . historically , this condition has been associated with hysteria and more recently in the scientific literature with post-traumatic stress and panic attacks .
