f for fake ( french : vérités et mensonges , " truths and lies " ) is the last major film completed by orson welles , who directed , co-wrote , and starred in the film . initially released in 1974 , it focuses on elmyr de hory 's recounting of his career as a professional art forger ; de hory 's story serves as the backdrop for a fast-paced , meandering investigation of the natures of authorship and authenticity , as well as the basis of the value of art . loosely a documentary , the film operates in several different genres and has been described as a kind of film essay . far from serving as a traditional documentary on elmyr de hory , the film also incorporates welles 's companion oja kodar , notorious " hoax-biographer " clifford irving , and orson welles as himself . in addition to the 88-minute film , in 1976 welles also shot and edited a self-contained 9-minute short film as a " trailer " , almost entirely composed of original material not found in the main film itself .
