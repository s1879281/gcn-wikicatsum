grizzly rage is a 2007 canadian television horror film produced by rhi entertainment that premiered in canada on the video-on-demand channel movie central on demand on june 7 , 2007 . it aired in the united states on the sci fi channel on september 16 , 2007 . filmed in winnipeg , manitoba , the film is the 2nd title in the maneater series produced under an agreement with syfy . featuring a cast of four , the film focuses on a group of teenagers who struggle to survive in a restricted forest while an enraged grizzly bear hunts them relentlessly seeking retribution for killing its cub . grizzly rage breaks the standard mold for many syfy natural horror films in that the bear featured is a normal grizzly bear rather than a mutant or genetically altered animal . however , the bear and actors never appear together in the same frame , rather a man in a bear suit takes over the role when the actors must interact with the bear . critics heavily panned the film , feeling its plot , script , characters , and special effects were substandard .
