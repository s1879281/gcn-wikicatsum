lolita is a 1962 british-american black comedy-drama film directed by stanley kubrick . based on his novel of the same title , vladimir nabokov also wrote the screenplay . it follows a middle-aged literature lecturer who becomes obsessed with an adolescent girl . the film stars james mason as humbert humbert , sue lyon as dolores haze ( lolita ) , and shelley winters as charlotte haze , with peter sellers as clare quilty . owing to the mpaa 's restrictions at the time , the film toned down the more provocative aspects of the novel , sometimes leaving much to the audience 's imagination . the actress who played lolita , sue lyon , was 14 at the time of filming . lolita polarized contemporary critics , but is well-received today . kubrick later commented , however , that if he had realized how severe the censorship limitations were going to be , he probably would never have made the film .
