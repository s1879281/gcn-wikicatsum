upilex is a heat-resistant polyimide film formed from biphenyl tetracarboxylic dianhydride ( bpda ) monomers . its properties include dimensional stability , low water absorption and high chemical resistance . it was developed by ube industries . upilex-s , along with other polyimides kapton hn and kapton e , have been investigated by nasa with respect to their radiation durability for possible use in the next generation space telescope , where polymer film layer sunshields must operate at low temperatures and in the presence of cosmic rays .
