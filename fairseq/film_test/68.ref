" according to hood , he attempted to weave together " what we know about austen 's world from her books and letters , " and believed austen 's personal life was the inspiration for pride and prejudice . jarrold began production of the film in early 2006 , opting to shoot primarily in ireland as he found it had better-preserved locations than hampshire , england , where austen was raised . released firstly in the united kingdom on 9 march 2007 and in other countries later in the year , becoming jane earned approximately $ 37 million worldwide . the film received mixed reviews from critics . hathaway 's performance received mixed critical reception , with some reviewers negatively focusing on her nationality and accent . commentators and scholars have analysed the presence of austen characters and themes within the film , and also noted the implementation of mass marketing in the film 's release .
