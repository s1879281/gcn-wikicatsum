the napoleonic code ( french : code napoléon ; officially code civil des français , referred to as ( le ) code civil ) is the french civil code established under napoléon i in 1804 . it was drafted by a commission of four eminent jurists and entered into force on 21 march 1804 . the code , with its stress on clearly written and accessible law , was a major step in replacing the previous patchwork of feudal laws . historian robert holtman regards it as one of the few documents that have influenced the whole world . the napoleonic code was not the first legal code to be established in a european country with a civil legal system ; it was preceded by the codex maximilianeus bavaricus civilis ( bavaria , 1756 ) , the allgemeines landrecht ( prussia , 1794 ) , and the west galician code ( galicia , then part of austria , 1797 ) . it was , however , the first modern legal code to be adopted with a pan-european scope , and it strongly influenced the law of many of the countries formed during and after the napoleonic wars . the napoleonic code influenced developing countries outside europe , especially in the middle east , attempting to modernize their countries through legal reforms .
