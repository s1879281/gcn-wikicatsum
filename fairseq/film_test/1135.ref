hollywood pinafore , or the lad who loved a salary is a musical comedy in two acts by george s. kaufman , with music by arthur sullivan , based on gilbert and sullivan 's h.m.s. pinafore . it opened on broadway at the alvin theatre on may 31 , 1945 , and closed on july 14 , 1945 after 52 performances . it was directed by kaufman himself and starred shirley booth , victor moore , george rasely , and william gaxton . the adaptation transplants the maritime satire of the original pinafore to a satire of the glamorous world of 1940s hollywood film making , but sullivan 's score is retained with minor adaptations . according to howard teichmann 's 1972 biography george s. kaufman : an intimate portrait , kaufman had the inspiration for hollywood pinafore during a poker game with his friend charles lederer . while lederer was arranging his cards , he idly sang a few bars of " when i was a lad " from pinafore while ad-libbing a new lyric : " oh , he nodded his head / and he never said ' no ' / and now he 's the head of the studio . " kaufman insisted on paying lederer a token fee for the idea of transplanting pinafore 's setting to a hollywood studio . although kaufman 's lyrics are witty , the book is static for a musical . however , it has been revived a number of times in recent years , including a 1998 " lost musicals " staged concert production at the barbican centre in london .
