mermaids is a documentary originally aired as mermaids : the body found on american tv channels animal planet ( may 27 , 2012 ) and discovery channel ( june 17 , 2012 ) . it tells a story of a scientific team 's investigative efforts to uncover the source behind mysterious underwater recordings of an unidentified marine body . the show presents the generally discredited aquatic ape hypothesis as evidence that mermaids exist , along with a digitally manufactured video . a sequel broadcast called mermaids : the new evidence aired may 26 , 2013 . mermaids : the body found , its sequel mermaids : the new evidence and several other similar programs dealing with other outrageous claims , such as the channel 4 's the last dragon and the fictional elements of the discovery channel 's shark week dealing with a purportedly discovered " monster " shark in megalodon : the monster shark lives are all recent examples of what is known as docufiction or a mockumentary , in which documentary style and programming elements are combined with fictional - or sometimes less egregiously speculative - science and fiction . this type of programming receives particular criticism when , as in the original broadcast of mermaids : the body found , there are only a few , easily missed disclaimers to indicate the speculative nature of the programming . on the contrary , the serious tone of the majority of the presentation implied that it was a factual documentary . the first airings of the two mermaids programs apparently fooled millions of people and also drew some of animal planet 's largest audiences ever .
