springtime in a small town ( chinese : 小城之春 ; pinyin : xiǎochéng zhī chūn ) is a 2002 chinese film directed by tian zhuangzhuang . the film is a remake of director fei mu 's 1948 film , spring in a small town . though the two movies are referred to by different english titles , they share the same title in chinese . springtime in a small town marks the return of tian zhuangzhuang to the director 's chair , following a nearly nine-year absence since his last film , the blue kite ( 1993 ) . it was funded by several production companies from china ( beijing film studio , beijing rosart film ) , france ( orly films , paradis films ) , and the netherlands ( fortissimo films ) . unlike kite , which deployed a large cast , spanned decades , and carried a political message , springtime is a small intimate chamber-piece .
