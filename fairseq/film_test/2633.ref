le corbeau ( the raven ) is a 1943 french film directed by henri-georges clouzot and starring pierre fresnay , micheline francey and pierre larquey . the film is about a french town where a number of citizens receive anonymous letters containing libelous information , particularly targeting an abortion doctor . the mystery surrounding the letters eventually escalates into violence . the film caused serious problems for its director after world war ii as it had been produced by continental films , a german production company established near the beginning of the occupation of france , and because the film had been perceived by the underground and the communist press as vilifying the french people . because of this , clouzot was initially blocked for life from directing in france and the film too was suppressed , although both bans only lasted until 1947 . the film was remade as the 13th letter ( 1951 ) by otto preminger .
