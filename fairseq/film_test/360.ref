eleven samurai ( japanese : 十一人の侍 romaji : jūichinin no samurai ) is a 1967 japanese jidaigeki ( period drama ) film directed by eiichi kudo . it is also referred to as 11 samurai . this is the third and final chapter in kudo 's samurai revolution trilogy . the plot is a samurai epic with a loose historical basis . " the young lord nariatsu was probably modeled after the real life figure of matsudaira nariyoshi , also known as matsudaira tokunosuke ( 1819-1839 ) , " who was the 19th or the 20th son of the shogun ienari ( 1787-1837 ) and the younger brother of the shogun ieyoshi ( 1837-1853 ) . " nariyoshi died when he was 19 years old -- a perfect fit for this story . the circumstances surrounding his death are obscure , which is also very convenient for dramatic purposes . "
