home for life , the founding documentary of kartemquin films released in 1967 , depicts the experiences of two elderly people in their first month at a home for the aged . one is a woman whose struggle to remain useful in her son and daughter-in-law 's home is no longer appreciated . the other is a widower , without a family , who suddenly realizes he can no longer take care of himself . the film offers an unblinking look at the feelings of the two new residents in their encounters with other residents , medical staff , social workers , psychiatrists and family . a touching , sometimes painfully honest dramatic experience , it is valuable for in-service staff training , and for all other audiences both professional and non-professional , interested in the problems of the aged . winning the chicago award at the chicago international film festival , as well as being an official selection at both the new york film festival and edinburgh film festival , kartemquin recently restored home for life and made their landmark film available to own on dvd .
