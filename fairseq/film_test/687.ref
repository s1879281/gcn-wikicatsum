taxi ! is a 1932 american pre-code gangster film starring james cagney and loretta young . the movie was directed by roy del ruth . the film includes two famous cagney dialogues , one of which features cagney conducting a conversation with a passenger in yiddish , and the other when cagney is speaking to his brother 's killer through a locked closet , " come out and take it , you dirty yellow-bellied rat , or i 'll give it to you through the door ! . " the provenance of this sequence led to cagney being famously misquoted as saying , " you dirty rat , you killed my brother . " also , taxi ! marks the first occasion when cagney dances on screen , as matt and sue enter a peabody contest at a nightclub . to play his competitor in a ballroom dance contest , cagney recommended his pal , fellow tough-guy-dancer george raft , who was uncredited in the film . in a lengthy and memorable sequence , he scene culminates with raft and his partner winning the dance contest against cagney and young , after which cagney slugs raft and knocks him down . as in the public enemy ( 1931 ) , several scenes in taxi ! involved the use of live machine-gun bullets . after a few of the bullets narrowly missed cagney 's head , he outlawed the practice in his future films . in the film they see a fictitious warner bros. movie at the cinema called her hour of love in which cagney cracks a joke about the film 's leading man 's appearance ( an unbilled cameo by warners contract player donald cook , who had played cagney 's brother in the public enemy ) saying , " his ears are too big " . also advertised in the cinema lobby in the film is the mad genius , an actual film starring john barrymore which was released the previous year by warners and is a plug by them .
